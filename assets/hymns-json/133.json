"Search me, O God, my actions try,=And let my life appear=As seen by Thine all searching eye:=To mine my ways make clear.",
"Search all my sense, and know my heart,=Who only canst make known;=And let the deep, the hidden part=To me be fully shown.",
"Throw light into the darkened cells,=Where passion reigns within;=Quicken my conscience till it feels,=The loathsomeness of sin.",
"Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,=The motives that control;=The chambers where polluted things=Hold empire over the soul.",
"Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast=Its holy light through all,=And I by grace am brought at last,=Before Thy face to fall.",
"Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee=What now I feebly prove=That God alone in Christ can be=Unutterable love!"],

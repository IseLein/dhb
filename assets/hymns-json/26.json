"Jesus, I my cross have taken,=All to leave, and follow Thee;=Destitute, despised, forsaken,=Thou, from hence, my all shalt be:=Perish ev'ry fond desire,=All I’ve sought, and hoped, and known;=Yet how rich is my condition,=God and Heav'n are still my own!",
"Let the world despise and leave me,=They have left my Saviour, too;=Human hearts and looks deceive me;=Thou art not, like man, untrue;=And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,=God of wisdom, love, and might,=Foes may hate, and friends may shun me;=Show Thy face, and all is bright.",
"Man may trouble and distress me,=‘Twill but drive me to thy breast;=Life with trials hard may press me,=Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest.=O 'tis not in grief to harm me,=While Thy love is left to me;=O 'twere not in joy to charm me,=Were that joy unmixed with Thee.",
"Haste thee on from grace to glory,=Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;=Heav'n's eternal day's before thee,=God's own hand shall guide thee there.=Soon shall close thy earthly mission,=Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,=Hope shall change to glad fruition,=Faith to sight, and prayer to praise."],

"I am determined to follow Jesus,=Walking the narrow way,=Finding my greatest joy in serving=Faithfully every day.=I am determined to go where He leads me,=To work where He needs me; Loyal forever;=Faithfully living, serving and giving=All of my life to Thee.",
"I am determined to do His bidding,=Whatever that may be;=Knowing whatever He desireth=Always is best for me.",
"I am determined to seek His counsel,=When dim my path may seem;=Soon will the dreary shadows vanish,=And golden sunlight gleam.",
"I am determined to tell the story,=Story of love divine;=So that in hearts now dark and dreary=Light, gospel light may shine."],

"Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!=That calls me from a world of care,=And bids me at my Father's throne=Make all my wants and wishes known.=In seasons of distress and grief,=My soul has often found relief=And oft escaped the tempter's snare=By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!",
"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!=The joys I feel, the bliss I share,=Of those whose anxious spirits burn=With strong desires for thy return!=With such I hasten to the place=Where God my Savior shows His face,=And gladly take my station there,=And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!",
"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!=Thy wings shall my petition bear=To Him whose truth and faithfulness=Engage the waiting soul to bless.=And since He bids me seek His face,=Believe His Word and trust His grace,=I'll cast on Him my every care,=And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!",
"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!=May I thy consolation share,=Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,=I view my home and take my flight:=This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise=To seize the everlasting prize;=And shout, while passing through the air,=“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”"],

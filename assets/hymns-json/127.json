"Saviour, more than life to me,=I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;=Let Thy precious blood applied,=Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.",
"Thro' this changing world below,=Lead me gently, gently as I go;=Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,=I can never, never lose my way.",
"Let me love Thee more and more,=Till this fleeting, fleeting life is ov'r;=Till my soul is lost in love,=In a brighter, brighter world above."],
"chorus": "Every day, every hour,=Let me feel Thy cleansing power;=May Thy tender love to me=Bind me closer, closer, Lord, to Thee.",

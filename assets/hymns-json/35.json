"You may build great cathedrals large or small,=You can build sky scrapers grand and tall,=You may conquer all the failures of the past,=But only what you do for Christ will last.",
"You may seek earthly power and fame,=The world might be impress'd by your great name,=Soon the glories of this life will all be past,=But only what you do for Christ will last.",
"Tho' your armies may control each hemisphere,=And your orbits out in space cause us to cheer,=Your scientific knowledge may be vast,=But only what you do for Christ will last.",
"Tho' your songs and prayers are heard and praised by all,=They 've no meaning unless you have heard the call,=Sinner, heed these words, don't let this harvest pass,=For only what you do for Christ will last."],
"chorus": "Remember only what you do for Christ will last;=Remember only what you do for Christ will last;=Only what you do for Him will be counted at the end,=Only what you do for Christ will last!",

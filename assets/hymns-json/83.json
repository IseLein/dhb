"Come, all Christians, be committed=To the service of the Lord.=Make your lives for Him more fitted,=Tune your hearts with one accord.=Come into His courts with gladness,=Each His sacred vows renew,=Turn away from sin and sadness,=Be transformed with life anew.",
"Of your time and talents give Him,=They are gifts from God above,=To be used by Christians freely=To proclaim His wondrous love.=Come again to serve the Saviour,=Tithes and offerings with you bring.=In your work, with Him find favour,=And with joy His praises sing.",
"God's command to love each other=Is required of everyone.=Showing mercy to each other=Mirrors His redeeming Son.=In compassion He has given=Of His love that is divine;=On the cross sins were forgiven;=Joy and peace are fully thine.",
"Come in praise and adoration,=All who on Christ's name believe.=Worship Him with consecration,=Grace and love will you receive.=For His grace give Him the glory,=For the Spirit and the Word,=And repeat the gospel story=Till the world His name has heard."],

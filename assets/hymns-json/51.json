"O Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end;=Be Thou forever near me, My Master and my friend;=I shall not fear the battle, If Thou art by my side,=Nor wander from the pathway If Thou wilt be my guide.",
"O Jesus, Thou hast promised To all who follow Thee,=That where Thou art in glory, There shall Thy servant be;=And, Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end;=O give me grace to follow My Master and my friend!",
"O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever near;=I see the sights that dazzle, The tempting sounds I hear;=My foes are ever near me, Around me and within;=But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer And shield my soul from sin.",
"O let me hear Thee speaking In accents clear and still,=Above the storms of passion, The murmurs of self-will.=O speak to reassure me, To hasten or control!=O speak, and make me listen, Thou guardian of my soul!",
"Oh, let me see Thy footmarks and in them plant my own;=My hope to follow duly is in Thy strength alone=Oh, guide me, call me, draw me, uphold me to the end;=And then in heavâ€™n receive me, my Saviour and my Friend."],

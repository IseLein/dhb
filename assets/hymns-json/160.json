"Stand up stand up for Jesus,=Ye soldiers of the cross!=Lift high His royal banner;=It must not suffer loss;=From vic-t'ry unto vic-t'ry=His army shall He lead,=Till ev-'ry foe is van-quish'd,=And Christ is Lord indeed.",
"Stand up, stand up for Jesus!=The trumpet call obey;=Forth to the mighty conflict,=In this His glorious day;=Ye that are men now serve Him=Against unnumbered foes;=Let courage rise with danger,=And strength to strength oppose.",
"Stand up, stand up for Jesus!=Stand in His strength alone!=The arm of flesh will fail you,=Ye dare not trust your own:=Put on the gospel armour,=And, watching unto prayer,=Where duty calls, or danger,=Be never wanting there.",
"Stand up, stand up for Jesus!=The strife will not be long;=This day the noise of battle,=The next the victor's song;=To him that overcometh=A crown of life shall be;=He with the King of glory=Shall reigns eternally."],

"All my life I had a longing=For a drink from some clear spring,=That I hoped would quench the burning=Of the thirst I felt within.",
"Feeding on the husks around me,=Till my strength was almost gone,=Longed my soul for something better,=Only still to hunger on.",
"Poor I was, and sought for riches,=Something that would satisfy,=But the dust I gathered round me=Only mocked my soul's sad cry.",
"Well of water, ever springing,=Bread of Life so rich and free,=Untold wealth that never faileth,=My Redeemer is to me."],
"chorus": "Hallelujah! I have found Him=Whom my soul so long has craved!=Jesus satisfies my longings,=Thro' His blood I now am saved.",

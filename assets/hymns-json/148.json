"The whole world was lost in the dark-ness of sin,=The Light of the world is Je-sus;=Like sun-shine at noon-day His glo-ry shone in,=The Light of the world is Je-sus.",
"No dark-ness have we who in Je-sus a-bide,=The Light of the world is Je-sus;=We walk in the light when we fol-low our guide,=The Light of the world is Je-sus.",
"Ye dwell-ers in dark-ness with sin-blind-ed eyes,=The Light of the world is Je-sus;=Go, wash, at His bid-ding, and light will a-rise,=The Light of the world is Je-sus",
"No need of the sun-light in heav-en we're told,=The Light of the world is Jesus;=The Lamb is the Light in the cit-y of gold,=The Light of the world is Je-sus."],
"chorus": "Come to the Light, 'tis shin-ing for thee=Sweet-ly the Light has dawned up-on me,=Once I was blind, but now I can see:=The Light of the world is Je-sus",

"Oh, for a clos-er walk with God,=A calm and heav'n-ly frame,=A light to shine up-on the road=That leads me to the Lamb!",
"Where is the bless-ed-ness I knew=When first I saw the Lord?=Where is the soul-re-fresh-ing view=Of Je-sus and His Word?",
"What peace-ful hours I then en-joyed!=How sweet their mem-'ry still!=But they have left an ach-ing void=The world can nev-er fill.",
"Re-turn, O Ho-ly Dove, re-turn,=Sweet mes-sen-ger of rest;=I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,=And drove Thee from my breast",
"The dearest idol I have know,=Whate'er that idol be=Help me to tear it from Thy throne=And worship Only Thee",
"So shall my walk be close with God,=Calm and serene my frame;=So purer light shall mark the road=That leads me to the Lamb."],

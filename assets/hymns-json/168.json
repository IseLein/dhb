"Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;=Unbelief disappear, Vanish each doubt and fear,=Fading when Thou art near-=Nothing between, nothing between.",
"Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;=Till Thine eternal light, Rising on earth's dark night,=Bursts on my open sight-=Nothing between, nothing between."],

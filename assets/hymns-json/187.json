"Immortal, invisible God only wise,=In light in accessible hid from our eyes,=Most blessed, most glorious the Ancient of Days,=Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.",
"Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,=Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;=Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,=Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.",
"To all, life Thou givest to both great and small;=In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;=We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree=And wither and perish but naught changeth Thee.",
"Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,=Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;=All praise we would render; O help us to see='Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee!"],

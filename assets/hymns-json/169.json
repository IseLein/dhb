"Am I a soldier of the cross,=A foll'wer of the Lamb?=And shall I fear to own His cause,=Or blush to speak His name?",
"Must I be carried to the skies,=On flow-'ry beds of ease=While others fought to win the prize,=And sailed thro' bloody seas?",
"Are there no foes for me to face?=Must I not stem the flood?=Is this vile world a friend to grace,=To help me on to God?",
"Sure I must fight if I would reign;=Increase my courage, Lord!=I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,=Supported by Thy Word."],

"O may this bounteous God=Thro’ all our life be near us,=With ever joyful hearts=And blessed peace to cheer us;=And keep us in His grace,=And guide us when perplexed,=And free us from all ills=In this world and the next.",
"All praise and thanks to God=The Father now be given,=The Son and Him who reigns,=With them in highest Heaven,=The One Eternal God,=Whom earth and Heav’n adore,=For thus it was is now,=And shall be evermore"],

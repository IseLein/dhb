"Nothing between my soul and my Saviour=Naught of this world's delusive dreams=I have renounced all sinful pleasure=Jesus is mine, there's nothing between",

"Nothing between like pride or station=Self or friends shall not intervene=Tho' it may cost me much tribulation=I am resolved; there's nothing between",

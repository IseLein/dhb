"In the cross of Christ I glory,=Towering o'er the wrecks of time;=All the light of sacred story=Gathers round its head sublime.",
"When the woes of life o'er-take me,=Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,=Never shall the cross forsake me:=Lo! It glows with peace and joy.",
"When the sun of bliss is beaming=Light and love upon my way,=From the cross the radiance streaming=Adds more luster to the day.",
"Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,=By the cross are sanctified;=Peace is there that knows no measure,=Joys that through all time abide. A men."],

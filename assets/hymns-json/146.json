"Come, Thou Fount of ev-'ry bless-ing,=Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;=Streams of mer-cy, nev-er ceas-ing,=Call for songs of loud-est praise:=Teach me some me-lo-dious son-net,=Sung by flam-ing tongues a-bove;=Praise the mount I'm fixed up-on it=Mount of Thy re-deem-ing love.",
"Here I raise mine Eb-en-e-zer;=Hith-er by Thy help I'm come;=And I hope, Thy good pleas-ure,=Safe-ly to ar-rive at home:=Je-sus sought me when a stran-ger,=Wan-d'ring from the fold of God;=He, to res-cue me from dan-ger,=In-ter-posed His pre-cious blood.",
"O to grace how great a debt-or=Dai-ly I'm constrained to be!=Let Thy grace Lord, like a fet-ter,=Bind my wan-d'ring heart to thee:=Prone to wan-der, Lord, I feel it,=Prone to leave the God I love;=Here's my heart, Lord take and seal it,=Seal it for thy courts a-bove."],

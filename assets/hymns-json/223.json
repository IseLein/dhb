"A charge to keep I have,=A God to glorify,=A never-dying soul to save,=And fit it for the sky.",
"To serve the present age,=My calling to fulfill:=O may it all my powâ€™rs engage=To do my Master's will!",
"Arm me with watchful care,=As in Thy sight to live;=And now Thy servant, Lord, prepare=A strict account to give!",
"Help me to watch and pray,=And still on Thee rely,=O let me not my trust betray,=But press to realms on high."],

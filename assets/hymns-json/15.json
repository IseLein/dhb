"Though like the wanderer, The sun gone down,=Darkness be over me, my rest a stone;=Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee;=Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.",
"There let the way appear, steps unto heav'n;=All that thou sendest me, in mercy giv'n;=Angels to beckon me, nearer, my God, to Thee;=Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.",
"Then, with my waking tho'ts bright with Thy praise,=Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;=So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee;=Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee.",
"Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,=Sun, Moon, and Stars forgot, upward I fly,=Still all my song shall be: Nearer, my God, to Thee;=Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee."],

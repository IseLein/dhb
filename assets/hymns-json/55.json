"The Master hath come, and He calls us to follow=The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;=Far over the mountain and thro' the deep hollow,=The path leads us on to the mansions of day:=The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,=Who march 'neath Christ's banner, His own little band;=We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,=And rest in the light of His beautiful land.",
"The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary,=And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;=But God's Holy spirit shall comfort the weary;=We follow the Saviour and cannot turn back;=The Master hath called us: tho' doubt and temptation=May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:=“Press onward, look up-ward,” thro' much tribulation;=The children of Zion must follow their King.",
"The Master hath called us, in life's early morning,=With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:=We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,=To cast in our lot with the people of God:=The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,=We plead for His blessing and trust in His love;=And thro' the green pastures, beside the still waters,=He'll lead us at last to His Kingdom above."],

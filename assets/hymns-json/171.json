"Onward Christian soldiers! Marching as to war,=Looking unto Jesus, Who is gone before,=Christ, the Royal Master, Leads against the foe;=Forward into battle See His banners go",
"At the name of Jesus Satan's host doth flee;=On then, Christian soldiers, On to victory!=Hell's foundations quiver At the shout of praise.=Brothers lift your voices; Loud your anthems raise",
"Like a mighty army Moves the church of God;=Brothers, we are treading, Where the saints have trod;=We are not divided, All one body we=One in hope and doctrine, One in charity.",
"Crowns and thrones may perish, Kingdoms rise and wane;=But the church of Jesus Constant will remain:=Gates of hell can never 'Gainst that church prevail;=We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail.",
"Onward then, ye people, Join our happy throng;=Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song:=“Glory, praise, and honour, unto Christ the King,”=This through countless ages men and angels sing."],

"In the Image of God we were made long ago=With the purpose divine, here His glory to show;=But we failed Him one day and like sheep went astray=Thinking not of the cost, We His likeness had lost.=But from eternity God had in mind the work of Calvary=The lost to find; From His heaven so broad,=Christ came down earth to trod=So that men might live again in the Image of God!",
"Now that I have believed and the Saviour received,=Now that I from the cry of my guilt am relieved,=I will live for my Lord, Not for gain or reward,=But for love thinking of what His grace has restored!=I'll never comprehend redemption's plan=How Christ could condescend to die for man;=Such a Saviour I'll praise to the end of my days,=As I up-ward, on-ward trod in the Image of God!"],

"Thou, my everlasting portion,=More than friend or life to me,=All along my pilgrim journey,=Saviour, let me walk with Thee.=Close to Thee, close to Thee,=Close to Thee, close to Thee;=All along my pilgrim journey,=Saviour, let me walk with Thee.",
"Not for ease or worldly pleasure=Nor for fame my pray’r shall be:=Gladly will I toil and suffer,=Only let me walk with Thee.=Close to Thee, close to Thee,=Close to Thee, close to Thee;=Gladly will I toil and suffer,=Only let me walk with Thee.",
"Lead me through the vale of shadows,=Bear me o’er life's fitful sea;=Then the gate of life eternal=May I enter, Lord, with Thee.=Close to Thee, close to Thee,=Close to Thee, close to Thee;=Then the gate of life eternal=May I enter, Lord, with Thee."],

"Must Jesus bear the cross alone=And all the world go free?=No there's a cross for everyone,=And there's a cross for me.",
"How happy are the saints above=Who once was sorrowing here=But now they taste unmingled love=And joy without a tear",
"The consecrated cross I'll bear=Till death shall set me free,=And then go home my crown to wear,=For there's a crown for me.",
"Upon the crystal pavement, down=At Jesus' pierced feet,=Joyful I'll cast my golden crown=And His dear name repeat.",
"O precious cross! O glorious crown!=O resurrection day!=When Christ the Lord, from heavâ€™n comes down=And bears my soul away."],

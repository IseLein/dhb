"My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;=For Thee, all the follies of sin I resign;=My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou;=If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.",
"I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,=And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;=I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;=If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.",
"I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,=And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;=And say, when the death dew lies cold on my brow;=If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.",
"In mansions of glory and endless delight,=I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;=And singing Thy praises, before Thee I'll bow;=If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.=Text : William R. Featherston;             GORDON=Music: Adoniram J. Gordon;                 11.11.11.11."],

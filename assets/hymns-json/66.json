"If I gained the world but lost the Saviour,=Were my life worth living for a day?=Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort=In the things that soon must pass away?=If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,=Would my gain be worth the life-long strife?=Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing=For a moment with a Christ-filled life?",
"Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,=And a name revered both far and near,=Yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting=Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer=If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,=Who endured the cross and died for me,=Could then all the world afford a refuge,=Whither in my anguish I might flee?",
"O what emptiness without the Saviour=Mid the sins and sorrows here below!=And eternity, how dark without Him=Only night and tears and endless woe!=What though I might live without the Saviour,=When I come to die, how would it be?=O to face the valley's gloom without Him!=And without Him all eternity!",
"O the joy of having all in Jesus!=What a balm the broken heart to heal!=Ne'er a sin so great but He'll forgive it,=Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!=If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,=Nothing else in all the world beside,=O then every thing is mine in Jesus=For my needs and more He will provide."],

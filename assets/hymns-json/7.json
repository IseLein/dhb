"Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,=Naught as an offâ€™ring to Jesus, my King=Only my sinful, now contrite heart.=Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart;=Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.",
"Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine!=Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,=All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride.=Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified;=Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.",
"Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,=Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;=Thro' endless ages ever to be=Nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee,=Nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee."],

"O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder,=Consider all the works Thy hands have made,=I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,=Thy pow'r thro'- out the universe displayed.",
"When thro' the woods and forest glades I wander,=And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;=When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,=And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:",
"And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,=Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;=That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,=He bled and died to take away my sin.",
"When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation,=And take me home, What joy shall fill my heart!=Then I shall bow in humble adoration.=And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!=Text : Stuart K. Hine;                    O STORE GUD=Music: Stuart K. Hine;                      11.10.11.10."],

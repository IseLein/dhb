"O I want to be like Jesus=As I walk along this pilgrim way;=O I want to live like Jesus,=Showing forth His beauty every day.=This my prayer and deepest longing=To be pure without, within;=O I want to be like Jesus,=Cleansed from dross and free from self and sin.",
"O I want to talk like Jesus,=Gracious are the words from Him we hear:=Words of life and hope for sinners,=Tender, healing words of love and cheer.=O the power and the value=Of a fitly spoken word!=O I want to talk like Jesus=Any time or place my voice is heard.",
"O I want to serve like Jesus,=Willingly He came from heaven above;=On the earth He lived for others,=Spent His life in kindly deeds of love.=I would follow where He leads me=And His biding always do;=O I want to serve like Jesus=Till my traveling days on earth are through."],

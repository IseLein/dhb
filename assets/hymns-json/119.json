"I would not ask for earthly store=Thou wilt my need supply;=But I would covet, more and more,=The clear and single eye,=To see my duty face to face,=And trust Thee, Lord, for daily grace.",
"I care not for the empty show=That thoughtless worldlings see;=But gladly do the best I know,=And leave the rest with Thee;=Well satisfied that sweet reward=Is sure to those who trust the Lord.",
"Whate’er the crosses mine shall be,=I would not dare to shun;=But only ask to live for Thee,=And that Thy will be done;=Thy will, O Lord, be mine each day,=While pressing on my homeward way.",
"And when at last, my labour o’er,=I cross the narrow sea,=Grant, Lord, that on the other shore=My soul may dwell with Thee;=And learn what here I cannot know,=Why Thou hast ever loved me so."],
"chorus": "Then shall my heart keep singing,=While to the cross I cling;=For rest is sweet at Jesus feet,=While homeward faith keeps winging,=While homeward faith keeps winging.",

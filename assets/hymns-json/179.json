"There's a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord=Where the call of His spirit is lost,=And you hurry along=With the pleasure mad throng-=Have you counted, have you counted the cost?",
"You may barter your hope of eternity's morn,=For a moment of joy at the most,=For the glitter of sin=And the things it will win-=Have you counted, have you counted the cost?",
"While the door of His mercy is open to you,=Ere the depth of His love you exhaust,=Won't you come and be healed,=Won't you whisper, I yield-=I have counted, I have counted the cost."],
"chorus": "Have you counted the cost, if your soul should be lost?=Tho' you gain the whole world for your own?=Even now it may be=that the line you have crossed,=Have you counted, have you counted the cost?",

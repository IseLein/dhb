"To God be the glory great things he hath done=So loved He the world that he gave us His son=Who yielded His life an atonement for sin=And opened the life gate that all may go in",
"O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood=To every believer the promise of God=The vilest offender who truly believes=That moment from Jesus a pardon receives",
"Great things He hath taught us great things He hath done=And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son=But purer and higher and greater will be=Our wonder our transport when Jesus we see."],
"chorus": "Praise the Lord, praise the Lord=Let the earth hear his voice=Praise the Lord praise the Lord=Let the people rejoice=Oh come to the Father through Jesus the son,=And give Him the glory great things He hath done.",

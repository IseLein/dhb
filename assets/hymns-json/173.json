"Give us o Lord, Thine unction=Anoint us for Thy work=Arise and set us in motion,=O Lord the man of war",
"Baptize us Lord with Thy fire=And set our soul aflame=To burn and shine for Thy cause;=Revive your zeal in us",
"Refine us Lord and cleanse us=Clothe us in holiness=Transform our thoughts and nature=Till we your glory show.",
"New hearts, more love, more passion=For souls in satan's train=With hook or net use us still;=Make us fishers of men.",
"Not gold, not power, not knowledge,=Will thy heaven unlock=But prayer and faith and unity,=Will bring the latter rain.",
"With tears and groans and fasting=O Lord help us to pray=Travailing as in birth for souls=Till you revive the church."],

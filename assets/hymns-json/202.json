"A mighty fortress is our God=A bulwark never failing=Our helper He, amid the flood=Of mortal ills prevailing:=For still our ancient foe,=Doth seek to work us woe;=His craft and power are great,=And, armed with cruel hate,=On earth is not his equal.",
"Did we in our own strength confide,=Our striving would be losing;=Were not the right Man on our side,=The Man of God's own choosing;=Dost ask who that may be?=Christ Jesus, it is He;=Lord Sabaoth, His name,=From age to age the same,=And He must win the battle.",
"And tho' this world, with devils filled,=Should threaten to undo us,=We will not fear for God hath willed=His truth to triumph through us:=The Prince of Darkness grim,=We tremble not for him;=His rage we can endure,=For lo, his doom is sure,=One little word shall fell him.",
"The word above all earthly powers,=No thanks to them, abideth;=The Spirit and the gifts are ours=Thro' Him who with us sideth:=Let goods and kindred go,=This mortal life also;=The body they may kill:=God's truth abideth still,=His Kingdom is forever."],

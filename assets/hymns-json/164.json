"If the world from you withhold=Of its silver and its gold,=And you have to get along with meager fare,=Just remember, in His word,=How he feeds the little birds;=Take your burden to the lord and leave it there",
"If your body suffers pain=And your health you can't regain,=And your soul is almost sinking in despair,=Jesus knows the pain you feel,=He can save and He can heal;=Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.",
"When your enemies assail=And your heart begins to fail,=Don't forget that God in heaven answers prayer;=He will make a way for you and will lead you safely thru;=Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.",
"When your youthful days are gone=And old age is stealing on,=And your body bends beneath the weight of care;=He will never leave you then,=He'll go with you to the end;=Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there."],
"chorus": "Leave it there, leave it there,=Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there;=If you trust and never doubt,=He will surely bring you out;=Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.",

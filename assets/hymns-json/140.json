"God of grace and God of glo-ry,=On Thy peo-ple pour Thy power;=Crown Thine an-cient church's sto-ry,=Bring her bud to glo-rious flower.=Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,=For the fac-ing of this hour,=For the fac-ing of this hour",
"Lo! The hosts of e-vil round us=Scorn Thy Christ, as-sail His ways!=Fears and doubts too long have bound us,=Free our hearts to work and praise.=Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,=For the liv-ing of these days,=For the liv-ing of these days.",
"Cure thy children warring madness=Bend our pride to thy control=Shame our wanton selfish gladness=Rich in things and poor in soul=Grant us wisdom, grant us courage=Lest we miss thy kingdom's goal=Lest we miss thy kingdom's goal",
"Set our feet on loft-y plac-es;=Gird our lives that they may be=Ar-mored with all Christ-like grac-es=In the fight to set men free.=Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,=That we fail not man nor thee!=That we fail not man nor thee!"],

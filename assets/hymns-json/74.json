"Far dearer than all that the world can impart=Was the message that came to my heart;=How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone,=And Calvary covers it all.",
"The stripes that He bore and the thorns that He wore=Told His mercy and love evermore;=And my heart bowed in shame as I called on His name,=And Calvary covers it all.",
"How matchless the grace, when I looked in the face=Of this Jesus, my crucified Lord;=My redemption complete I then found at His feet,=And Calvary covers it all.",
"How blessed the thought, that my soul by Him bought,=Shall be His in the glory on high,=Where with gladness and song I'll be one of the=throng,"],
"chorus": "Calvary covers it all,=My past with its sin and stain;=My guilt and despair Jesus took on Him there,=And Calvary covers it all.",

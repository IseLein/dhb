"Jesus wept! Those tears are o-ver,=But His heart is still the same;=Kins-man, Friend, and Elder Brother=Is His ev-er-lasting name.=Saviour, who can love like Thee,=Gracious One of Beth-a-ny!",
"When the pangs of trial seize us,=When the waves of sorrow roll,=I will lay my head on Jesus,=Pillow of the troubled soul.=Sure-ly, none can feel like Thee,=Gracious One of Beth-a-ny!",
"Jesus wept! And still in glo-ry,=He can mark each mourner's tear;=Liv-ing to re-trace the story=Of the hearts He sol-aced here.=Lord, when I am called to die,=Let me think of Beth-a-ny!",
"Jesus wept! That tear of sor-row=Is a leg-a-cy of love;=Yes-ter-day, to-day, to-mor-row,=He the same doth ev-er prove.=Thou art all in all to me,=Liv-ing One of Beth-a-ny!"],

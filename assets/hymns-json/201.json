"I gave my life for thee=My precious blood I shed,=That thou might'st ransomed be,=And quickened from the dead;=I gave I gave my life for thee,=What hast thou giv'n for me,=I gave I gave my life for thee,=What hast thou giv'n for Me?",
"I spent long years for thee=In weariness and woe=That an eternity=Of joy Thou mightest know=I spent, I spent long years for thee=Hast thou spent one for Me?=I spent, I spent long years for thee=Hast thou spent one for Me?",
"My Father's house of light,=My glory-circled Throne,=I left for earthly night,=For wand'ring sad and lone;=I left I left it all for thee,=Hast thou left aught for Me?=I left I left it all for thee,=Hast thou left aught for Me?",
"I suffered much for thee,=More than thy tongue can tell=Of bitt'rest agony,=To rescue thee from hell;=I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,=What hast thou borne for me=I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,=What hast thou borne for me",
"And I have brought to thee,=Down from my home above,=Salvation full and free=My pardon and my love;=I bring, I bring rich gift to thee,=What hast thou brought to me?=I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee=What hast thou brought to me?",
"Oh, let my life be given=My years for Him be spent=World-fetters all be riven,=And joy with suffering bent!=Thou gavest Thou gavest Thyself for me;=I give myself to Thee=Thou gavest Thou gavest Thyself for me;=I give myself to Thee"],

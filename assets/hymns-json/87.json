"And can it be that I should gain=An interest in the Saviour's blood?=Died He for me, who caused His pain?=For me, who Him to death pursued?=Amazing love! How can it be=That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me!=Amazing love! How can it be=That Thou, my God, should die for me!",
"He left His Father's throne above,=So free, so infinite His grace!=Emptied Himself of all but love,=And bled for Adam's helpless race!='Tis mercy all, immense and free,=O Praise my God, it reaches me=Amazing love! How can it be=That Thou, my God, should die for me!",
"Long my imprisoned spirit lay=Fast bound in sin and nature's night.=Thine eye diffused a quickening ray;=I woke the dungeon flamed with light!=My chains fell off, my heart was free,=I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.=Amazing love! How can it be=That Thou, my God, should die for me!",
"No condemnation now I dread:=Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!=Alive in Him, my living Head,=And clothed in righteousness divine,=Bold I approach the eternal throne,=And claim the crown, through Christ my own.=Amazing love! How can it be=That Thou, my God, should die for me!"],

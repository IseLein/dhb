"It pays to serve Jesus, I speak from my heart,=He'll always be with us, if we do our part,=There's naught in this wide world can pleasure afford,=There's peace and contentment in serving the Lord.",
"And often when I'm tempted to turn from the track=I think of my Saviour, my mind wanders back,=To the cross where they nailed Him on Calvary's tree=I hear a voice saying, “I suffered for thee,”",
"A place I remember where I was set free,=It’s where I found pardon, a heaven to me,=There Jesus spoke sweetly, to my weary soul,=My sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole.",
"How rich is the blessing the world cannot give.=I’m satisfied fully for Jesus to live,=Tho: friends may forsake me and trials arise,=I’m trusting in Jesus, His love never dies.",
"There is no one like Jesus can cheer me today,=His love and His kindness can ne’er fade away,=In winter, in summer; in sunshine and rain=His love and affection are always the same",
"Will you have this blessing that Jesus bestows?=Free, full, salvation from sin bitter throes=O come to the Saviour to Calvary flee,=The fountain is opened is flowing for thee."],
"chorus": "I'll love Him far better than in days of youth=I'll serve Him more truly than ever before,=I'll do as He bids me whatever the cost,=I'll be a true soldier, I'll die at my post.",

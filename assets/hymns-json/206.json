"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun=Does its successive journeys run:=His Kingdom spread from shore to shore,=Till moons shall wax, and wane no more.",
"To Him shall endless prayâ€™r be made,=And endless praises crown His head;=His Name like sweet perfume shall rise=With every morning sacrifice.",
"People and realms of every tongue=Dwell on His love with sweetest song;=And infant voices shall proclaim=Their early blessings on His Name.",
"Blessings abound where'er He reigns;=The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;=The weary finds eternal rest,=And all the sons of wants are blest.",
"Let every creature rise and bring=Honour and glory to our King,=Angels descend with songs again,=And earth repeat the loud Amen."],

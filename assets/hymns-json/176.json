"What a friend we have in Jesus,=All our sins and griefs to bear;=What a privilege to carry=Ev'rything to God in prayer=Oh, what peace we often forfeit,=Oh, what needless pain we bear-=All because we do not carry=Ev'rything to God in prayer.",
"Have we trials and temptations?=Is there trouble anywhere?=We should never be discouraged,=Take it to the Lord in prayer.=Can we find a Friend so faithful,=Who will all our sorrows share?=Jesus knows our every weakness=Take it to the Lord in prayer.",
"Are we weak and heavy laden=Cumbered with a load of care?=Precious Saviour, still our refuge,-=Take it to the Lord in prayer,=Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?=Take it to the Lord in prayer;=In His arms He'll take and shield thee,=Thou wilt find a solace there."],

"verses": [
"Will your anchor hold in the storms of life?=When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?=When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,=Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?",
"Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear,=When the breakers roar and the reef is near?=While the surges rave, and the wild winds blow,=Shall the angry waves then your bank o'er flow",
"Will your anchor hold in the floods of death,=When the waters cold chill your latest breath?=On the rising tide, you can never fail,=While your anchor holds within the veil.",
"Will your eyes behold through the morning light=The city of gold and the harbour bright?=Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore,=When life's storms are past for evermore?"],
"chorus": "We have an anchor that keeps the soul=Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;=Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,=Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love!",

"Set my soul a-fire, Lord for Thy ho-ly Word,=Burn it deep within me, Let Thy voice be heard;=Mil-lions grope in dark-ness in this day and hour,=I will be a witness, fill me with Thy pow'r",
"Set my soul a-fire, Lord, for the lost in sin,=Give to me a passion as I seek to win;=Help me not to falter, nev-er let me fail,=Fill me with Thy Spirit, let Thy will pre-vail.",

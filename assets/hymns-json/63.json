"I saw the cross of Jesus, When burdened with my sin;=I sought the cross of Jesus, To give me peace within;=I brought my soul to Jesus, He cleansed it in His blood;=And in the cross of Jesus I found my peace with God.",
"I love the cross of Jesus, It tells me what I am=A vile and guilty creature, Saved only thro' the Lamb;=No righteousness nor merit, No beauty can I plead;=Yet in the cross I glory, My title there I read.",
"I trust the cross of Jesus, In every trying hour,=My sure and certain refuge, My never failing tow'r;=In every fear and conflict, I more than conqueror am;=Living, I'm safe, or dying, Thro' Christ, the risen Lamb.",
"Safe in the cross of Jesus! There let my weary heart=Still rest in peace unshaken, Till with Him, neâ€™er to part;=And then in strains of glory I'll sing His wondrous pow'r,=Where sin can never enter, And death is known no more."],

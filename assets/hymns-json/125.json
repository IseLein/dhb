"All the way my Saviour leads me=What have I to ask beside?=Can I doubt His tender mercy,=Who through life has been my guide?=Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,=Here by faith in Him to dwell!=For I know, whate’er befall me,=Jesus doeth all things well;=For I know, whate’er befall me,=Jesus doeth all things well.",
"All the way my Saviour leads me=Cheers each winding path I tread.=Gives me grace for every trial,=Feeds me with the living bread.=Though my weary steps may falter=And my soul a thirst may be,=Gushing from the Rock before me,=Lo! A spring of joy I see;=Gushing from the Rock before me,=Lo! A spring of joy I see.",
"All the way my Saviour leads me=O the fullness of His love!=Perfect rest to me is promised=In my Father's house above.=When my spirit, clothed immortal,=ALL THE WAY MY SAVIOUR LEADS ME=Wings its flight to realms of day,=This my song through endless ages:=Jesus led me all the way;=This my song through endless ages:=Jesus led me all the way."],

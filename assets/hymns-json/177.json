"Are we weak and heavy laden=Cumbered with a load of care?=Precious Saviour, still our refuge,-=Take it to the Lord in prayer,=Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?=Take it to the Lord in prayer;=In His arms He'll take and shield thee,=Thou wilt find a solace there.=How amiable are thy tabernacles,=O Lord of hosts!=How amiable are thy tabernacles,=O Lord of hosts!=My soul longeth, and even fainteth=For the courts of the Lord:=My heart and my flesh crieth out=For the living God."],

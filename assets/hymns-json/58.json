"My faith looks up to Thee,=Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour divine!=Now hear me while I pray, Take all my guilt away,=O let me from this day be wholly Thine!",
"May Thy rich grace impart=Strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire;=As Thou hast died for me, O may my love to Thee=Pure, warm, and changeless be a living fire!",
"While life's dark maze I tread,=And griefs around me spread, be Thou my guide;=Bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow's tears away,=Nor let me ever stray from Thee aside.",
"When ends life's transient dream,=When death's cold, sullen stream shall o'er me roll,=Blest Saviour then in love, fear and distrust remove;=O bear me safe above, a ransomed soul!"],

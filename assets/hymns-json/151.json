"What can I give to Je-sus,=Who gave Him-self for me?=How can I show my love for Him,=Who died on cal-va-ry?=I'll give my life to Je-sus,=And calm-ly, glad-ly rest=Each fu-ture hope and fond de-sire=Up-on His lov-ing breast.",
"I'll give my voice to Je-sus,=And seek through all my days=My ev-'ry tal-ent con-se-crate=To sing His joy-ous praise.=I'll give my strength to Je-sus,=Of head, of heart, and will;=Go where He sends and ev-er strive=His pur-pose to ful-fil.",
"I'll give my wealth to Je-sus,=Tho' lit-tle I pos-sess;=Take what I am and what I have,=Dear Lord, ac-cept and bless.=What can I give to Je-sus,=Who gave Him-self for me?=I'll give my all to Je-sus,=Who died on Cal-va-ry."],

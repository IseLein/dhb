"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,=That saved a wretch like me!=I once was lost, but now am found,=Was blind, but now I see.",
"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,=And grace my fears relieved!=How precious did that grace appear=The hour I first believed!",
"Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,=I have already come;='Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far,=And grace will lead me home.",
"The Lord has promised good to me,=His word my hope secures;=He will my shield and portion be=As long as life endures.",
"Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,=And mortal life shall cease,=I shall possess within the vail,=A life of joy and peace.",
"When we've been there ten thousand years,=Bright shining as the sun,=We've no less days to sing God's praise=Than when we first begun."],

"Be Thou my Guardian and my guide=And hear me when I call=Let not my slippery footsteps slide,=And hold me lest I fall",
"The world, the flesh, and Satan dwell=Around the part I tread=O save me from the snares of hell,=Thou Quickner of the dead.",
"And if I am tempted to sin,=And outward things are strong,=Do Thou, O LORD, keep watch within,=And save my soul from wrong",
"Still let me ever watch and pray,=And feel that I am frail:=That if the Tempter cross my way,=Yet he may not prevail."],

"“Are ye able,” said the Master,=“To be crucified with me?”=“Yea,” the sturdy dreamers answered,=“To the death we follow Thee:”",
"“Are ye able” to remember,=When a thief lifts up his eyes,=That his pardoned soul is worthy=Of a place in paradise?",
"“Are ye able?” still the Master=Whispers down eternity,=And heroic spirits answer,=Now, as then in Galilee:"],
"chorus": "“Lord, we are able” our spirits are Thine;=Mould them make us like Thee, divine.=Thy guiding radiance above us shall be=A beacon to God, to love and loyalty",

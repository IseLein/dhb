"Living for Jesus a life that is true,=Striving to please Him in all that I do,=Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,=This is the pathway of blessing for me.",
"Living for Jesus who died in my place,=Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace,=Such love constrains me to answer His call,=Follow His leading and give Him my all.",
"Living for Jesus wherever I am,=Doing each duty in His holy name,=Willing to suffer affliction or loss,=Deeming each trial a part of my cross.",
"Living for Jesus thro' earth's little while,=My dearest treasure, the light of His smile,=Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,=Bringing the weary to find rest in Him."],
"chorus": "O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to Thee;=For Thou, in thine Atonement, Didst give Thyself for me;=I own no other Master, My heart shall be Thy throne,=My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.",

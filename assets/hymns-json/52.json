"O God, our help in ages past,=Our hope for years to come,=Our shelter from the stormy blast,=And our eternal home!",
"Under the shadow of Thy throne=Thy saints have dwelt secure;=Sufficient is Thine arm alone,=And our defense is sure.",
"Before the hills in order stood,=Or earth received her frame,=From everlasting Thou art God,=To endless years the same.",
"A thousand ages in Thy sight=Are like an evening gone;=Short as the watch that ends the night=Before the rising sun.",
"Time, like an ever-rolling stream,=Bears all its sons away;=They fly, forgotten, as a dream=Dies at the opâ€™ning day.",
"O God, our help in ages past,=Our hope for years to come,=Be Thou our guard while life shall last,=And our eternal home."],

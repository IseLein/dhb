"Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,=Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!=Yonder on Calvary's mount out-poured=There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.",
"Sin and despair, like the sea-waves cold,=Threaten the soul with infinite loss:=Grace that is greater yes, grace untold=Points to the Refuge, the mighty Cross.",
"Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,=What can avail to wash it away?=Look! There is flowing a crimson tide=Whiter than snow you may be today.",
"Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace.=Freely bestowed on all who believe!=You that are longing to see His face,=Will you this moment His grace receive?"],
"chorus": "Grace, grace, God's grace,=Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;=Grace, grace, God's grace,=Grace that is greater than all our sins!",

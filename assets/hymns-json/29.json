"You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase,=And have earnestly, fervently prayed;=But you cannot have rest or be perfectly blest=Until all on the altar is laid.",
"Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,=And have peace and contentment always?=You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill,=On the altar your all you must lay.",
"O we never can know what the Lord will bestow=Of the blessings for which we have prayed=Till our body and soul He doth fully control,=And our all on the altar is laid.",
"Who can tell all the love He will send from above,=And how happy our hearts will be made;=Of the fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet=When our all on the altar is laid."],
"chorus": "Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?=Your heart, does the Spirit control?=You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest=As you yield Him your body and soul.",

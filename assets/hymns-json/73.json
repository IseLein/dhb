"Life was shattered and hope was gone=Crushing the load that I bore;=Then out of the depths I cried, “O God,=Give me something worth living for.”",
"There, with life at its lowest ebb,=Who could heal and restore?=Then He came and mended my broken heart-=He gave me something worth living for.",
"O the joy of sins forgiven-=Nothing's the same as before;=My life overflows since Jesus came=And gave me something worth living for."],
"chorus": "Something more than my yesterdays,=More than I had before,=Something more than wealth or fame-=He gave me something worth living for.",

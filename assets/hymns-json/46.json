"“Take up your cross,” the Saviour said=“If you would My disciple be;=Deny yourself, the world forsake,=And humbly follow after me.”",
"Take up your cross; let not its weight=Fill your weak spirit with alarm;=His strength shall bear your spirit up,=And brace your heart and nerve your arm.",
"Take up your cross; heed not the shame;=Let not your foolish pride rebel;=The Lord for us the cross endured,=To save our souls from death and hell.",
"Take up your cross and follow Christ;=Think not till death to lay it down;=For only those who bear the cross=May hope to wear the glorious crown."],

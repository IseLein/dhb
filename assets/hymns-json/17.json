"I 'm pressing on the upward way,=New heights I'm gaining every day;=Still praying as I onward bound=“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”",
"My heart has no desire to stay=Where doubts arise and fears dismay;=Tho' some may dwell where these abound,=My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.",
"I want to live above the world,=Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;=For faith has caught the joyful sound,=The song of saints on higher ground.",
"I want to scale the utmost height=And catch a gleam of glory bright;=But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,=“Lord lead me on to higher ground.”"],
"chorus": "Lord, lift me up and let me stand=By faith on heaven's table land;=A higher plane than I have found=Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.",

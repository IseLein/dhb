"Thy Kingdom come, O God;=Thy rule, O Christ, begin;=Break with Thine iron rod=The tyrannies of sin.",
"Where is Thy reign of peace,=And purity, and love?=When shall all hatred cease,=As in the realms above?",
"When comes the promised time=That war shall be no more?=And lust, oppression, crime,=Shall flee Thy face before?",
"We pray Thee, Lord, arise,=And come in Thy great might;=Revive our longing eyes,=Which languish for Thy sight.",
"Men scorn Thy sacred Name,=And wolves devour Thy folds;=By many deeds of shame=We learn that love grows cold.",
"O'er hearthen lands afar=Thick darkness broodeth yet;=Arise, O Morning Star,=Arise, and never set."],

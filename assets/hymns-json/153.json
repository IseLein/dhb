"O worship the King, All glorious above,=O gratefully sing, His power and His love:=Our Shield and Defender,=The Ancient of Days,=Pavilioned in splendour,=And girded with praise.",
"O tell of His might, O sings of His grace,=Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space.=His chariots of wrath=The deep thunder-clouds form,=And dark is His path=On the wings of the storm.",
"Thy bountiful care, What tongue can recite?=It breathes in the air, It shines in the light,=It streams from the hills,=It descends to the plain,=And sweetly distils=In the dew and the rain.",
"Frail children of dust, And feeble as frail;=In Thee do we trust, Nor find Thee to fail;=Thy mercies, how tender,=How firm to the end,=Our Maker, Defender,=Redeemer and Friend!.",
"O measureless Might! Ineffable Love!=While angels delight, To hymn Thee above,=The humbler creation,=Though feeble their lays,=With true adoration=Shall lisp to Thy praise."],

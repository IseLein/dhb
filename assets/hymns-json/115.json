"Lord, speak to me, that I may speak,=In living echoes of Thy tone=As Thou hast sought, so let me seek=Thy erring children lost and lone.",
"Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead,=The wandering and the wavering feet=O, feed me, Lord, that I may feed=Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.",
"Oh, strengthen me, that While I stand=Firm on the rock and strong in Thee,=I may stretch out a loving hand=To wrestlers with the troubled sea.",
"Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach=The precious things Thou dost impart,=And wing my words that they may reach=The hidden depths of many a heart.",
"Oh bend my will and make it thine=My inner man broken and meek=Living my all only for Thee,=Until Thy blessed face I see.",
"Oh, give thine own sweet rest to me,=That I may speak with soothing power=A word in season, as from thee=To weary ones in needful hour.",
"Oh fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,=Until my very heart oâ€™er flow=In kindling thought, and glowing word,=Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show"],
"chorus": "O use me LORD, use even me,=Just as Thou wilt and when and where=Until Thy blessed face I see=Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.",

"I love to tell the story of unseen things above,=Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love;=I love to tell the story because I know 'tis true,=It satisfies my longing as nothing else can do.",
"I love to tell the story 'tis pleasant to repeat=What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet,=I love to tell the story, for some have never heard=The message of salvation from God's own holy word.",
"I love to tell the story, for those who know it best=Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;=And when in scenes of glory I sing the new, new song,=‘Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long."],

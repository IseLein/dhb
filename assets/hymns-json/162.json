"I must needs go home by the way of the cross,=There's no other way but this;=I shall ne'er get sight of the gates of light,=If the way of the cross I miss.",
"I must needs go on in the blood sprinkled way,=The path that the Saviour trod,=If I ever climb to the heights sublime,=Where the soul is at home with God.",
"Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,=To walk in it never more;=For the Lord says, “Come,” and I seek my home,=Where He waits at the open door."],
"chorus": "The way of the cross leads home,=The way of the cross leads home;=It is sweet to know as I onward go,=The way of the cross leads home.",

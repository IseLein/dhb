"Years I spent in vanity and pride,=Caring not my Lord was Crucified,=Knowing not it was for me=He died on Calvary.",
"By God's Word at last my sin I learned;=Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,=Till my guilty soul imploring turned=To Calvary.",
"Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'ry thing,=Now I gladly own Him as my King,=Now my raptured soul can only sing=Of Calvary",
"Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!=Oh, the grace that bro't it down o man!=Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span=At Calvary."],
"chorus": "Mercy there was great, and grace was free;=Pardon there was multiplied to me;=There my burdened soul found liberty,=At Calvary.",

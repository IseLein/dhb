"Lord, for to-mor-row and its needs=I do not pray;=Keep me, my God, from stain of sin Just for to-day:=Help me to labour ear-nest-ly, and du-ly pray;=Let me be kind in word and deed,=Fa-ther, to-day.",
"Let me no wrong or I-dle word,=Un-think-ing say;=Set Thou a seal up-on my lips Through all to-day:=Let me in sea-son, Lord, be grave, In sea-son, gay;=Let me be faith-ful to Thy grace,=Dear Lord, to-day.",
"In pain and sor-row's cleans-ing fires,=Brief be my stay;=O bid me, if to-day I die, Come home to-day:=So for to-mor-row and its needs I do not pray;=But keep me, love me, Lord,=Just for to-day."],

"As with glad-ness men of old=Did the guid-ing star be-hold;=As with joy they hailed its light,=Lead-ing on-ward, beam-ing bright;=So most gra-cious Lord, may we=Ev-er-more be led to Thee.",
"As with joy-ous steps they sped=To that low-ly man-ger bed,=There to bend the knee be-fore=Him whom heavâ€™n and earth a-dore;=So may we with will-ing feet=Ev-er seek Thy mer-cy seat.",
"As they of-fered gifts most rare=At that man-ger rude and bare,=So may we with ho-ly joy,=Pure and free from sin's al-loy,=All our cost-liest treas-ures bring,=Christ, to thee, our heaven-ly King.",
"Ho-ly Je-sus, ev-ery day=Keep us in the nar-row way;=And when earth-ly things are past,=Bring our ran-somed souls at last=Where they need no star to guide,=Where no clouds Thy glo-ry hide."],

"Some folk may choose houses and land=Some folk choose silver and gold=These worldly wealth they may treasure=And forget about their souls",
"These clothes may be ragged that I wear=Heavy the load that I bear=Yet the kingdom path I shall tread=Till I see the Master’s face",
"Poor and wretched though I may be=Neglected by friends and kin=Yet I’ll follow Jesus my Lord=Until to His rest I come",
"Though the world and its wealth I loose=And my life along with them=Yet press I unto His sweet rest=And take my place in His court"],
"chorus": "I’ve decided to choose Jesus=The road in life may be rough=And the going through the paths gets tough=And the hills are hard to climb=I’ve started out with the Master=Long time ago in His steps=Yes, there is no doubt in my mind=I have made Jesus my choice",

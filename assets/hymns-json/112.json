"That I may know more about Jesus,=His life His death and resurrection:=In fellowship to experience Him more,=Who is a man, and not a ghost.=Father show me more of Jesus,=Holy Spirit reveal Him to me.=To His fullness that I may grow.=To follow in His steps always.",
"Jesus Christ the only Son of God,=Yet grew like a root out of dry ground.=He was perfected by God through suffering.=Leaving for us example to walk.=When insulted retaliated not:=When He suffered He made no threat.=Why then should I complain of pains=Meant to perfect my ways in Him.",
"Jesus Christ the only pattern Son.=Tempted in all ways but did no sin.=Hated sin, but loved righteousness!=Therefore God exalted Him high.=To be like Jesus my heart longs,=Ready to shed my blood than to sin;=To be clear minded on my goal=Nothing but Jesus, all I want.",
"By His Nature, He is truly God,=Yet as a Branch He choose to be;=Depending on God in everything,=Doing only the will of God.=Impart this secret Lord to me,=That in thy will my own to be lost;=Help me a branch always to be,=Never to live independent life.",
"Tho' in very Nature He is God,=He surrendered His rights as God=In obedience He became servant=And as a man, died on the crossâ€¦=What unequalled humility=What a lowliness of the hearts!=Help me to drop my rights, O Lord=So that Jesus be formed in me.",
"Oh, that I may know more of Jesus!=His prayer life, love and compassion.=His resurrection power I long to know,=To break all wrong yokes off my life.=Guide me Lord in your steps to walk,=Doing nothing after the flesh.=Transform me till I'm wholly thine=That Jesus be my all in all."],
"chorus": "That I may know Him!=Father show me more of Jesus,=Holy Spirit reveal Him to me.=My cry, my prayer, my aim is one:=That I may know Him=Who is God's only pattern for me.",

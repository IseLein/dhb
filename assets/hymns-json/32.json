"Arm me LORD for revival=To turn my generation to thee;=To thy glory course of history to change;=To thy acknowledgement all hears to bring;=To cause every knee for thee to bow=Arm me, else impotent I am.",
"Daily LORD in my heart I cry:=“Will thou not revive us again?”=This I know you need me as a vessel,=A new cruise, prepared and meet for your use,=Yet crude, and unclean and shallow I am,=Cleanse, mould and fit me for revival.",
"What a wretched man LORD, I am;=Thought yearning to win the souls of men=My intellect and wisdom has failed me;=My efforts have achieved no lasting fruit=Truly, in my flesh dwells no good thing!=Arm me LORD, for genuine revival.",
"Create in me the revival life=My life, weak for revival has proved,=Blunt in circumcising men's hearts around,=Impotent in confronting my mountains.=Before Thee prostrate I LORD, for help.=Trim and equip me for revival.",
"To thy throne LORD, again I come.=Earnest pleading for a touch divine.=Release me not until I am revived;=Detain me until fully helped I am.=Till my glory only be in the cross.=Arm me LORD, for revival I pray."],
"chorus": "Arm me LORD, for true revival.=Uncircumcised hearts around me abound,=Men so deep in sin and wickedness.=Yet helpless, impotent, blunt I am=Deliver me from this body of death, O LORD=Shape and sharpen me for revival.",

"The mercies of God! What a theme for my song=Oh!I never could number them o'er;=They are more than the stars in the heavenly dome,=Or the sands of the wave beaten shore.",
"They greet me at morn when I woken from sleep,=And they gladden my heart at the noon;=They follow me on into shades of the night,=When the day with its labour is done.",
"His angels of mercy encompass me 'round,=Wheresoever my pathway may lead;=Each turn of the road some new token reveals=Oh! For me life is blessed indeed.",
"His goodness and mercy will follow me still,=Even unto the end of the way.=I have His sure promise and that cannot fail,=That His mercy endureth for aye"],
"chorus": "For mercies so great, what return can I make?=For mercies so constant and sure=I'll love Him, I'll serve Him with all that I have=As long as my life shall endure.",

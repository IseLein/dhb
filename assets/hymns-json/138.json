"If your life in days gone by,=Has not been good and true,=In your own way no longer try.=But let Him fix it for you.=Let Jesus fix it for you.=He knows just what to do;=When-ev-er you pray, let Him have His way,=And He will fix it for you.",
"Perhaps your temper is to blame,=For man-y wrongs you do,=Take it to God in Jesus' name,=And He will fix it for you.",
"If in your home the trouble is,=The course you should pur-sue,=Go talk with God, your hand in His,=And He will fix it for you.",
"And if some sin your soul hath bound=With cords you can't un-do,=At Jesus' feet go lay it down,=And He will fix it for you.",
"May-be to you the world is dark.=And comforts far and few,=Let Jesus own and rule your heart,=And He will fix it for you."],

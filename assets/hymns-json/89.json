"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,=Let me hide myself in Thee=Let the water and the blood=From Thy wounded side which flowed=Be of sin the double cure=Save me from its guilt and pow'r",
"Not the labour of my hands=Can fulfil the Thy law's demands;=Could my zeal no respite know,=Could my tears for ever flow,=All for sin could not atone;=Thou must save and Thou alone.",
"Nothing in my hand I bring;=Simply to Thy Cross I cling!=Naked, come to Thee for dress;=Helpless, look to Thee for grace;=Foul, I to the fountain fly;=Wash me saviour, or I die.",
"While I draw this fleeting breath,=When mine eyes shall close in death'=When I soar to world unknown,=See Thee on Thy Judgment throne;=Rock of Ages, cleft for me,=Let me hide myself in Thee"],

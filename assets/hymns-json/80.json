"Open my eyes, that I may see=Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;=Place in my hands the wonderful key=That shall unclasp and set me free:=Silently now I wait for Thee,=Ready, my God, Thy will to see;=Open my eyes, illumine me,=Spirit divine!",
"Open my ears, that I may hear=Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;=And while the wave-notes fall on my ear,=Everything false will disappear:=Silently now I wait for Thee,=Ready, my God, Thy will to see;=Open my eyes, illumine me,=Spirit divine!",
"Open my mouth, and let me bear=Gladly the warm truth everywhere;=Open my heart, and let me prepare=Love with Thy children, thus to share:=Silently now I wait for Thee,=Ready, my God, Thy will to see;=Open my eyes, illumine me,=Spirit divine!"],

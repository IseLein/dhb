"More like the Master I would ever be,=More of His meekness, More humility;=More zeal to labour, more courage to be true,=More consecration for work He bids me do.=Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;=Take Thou my heart and make it all Thine Own=Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore=Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore.",
"More like the Master is my daily prayer;=More strength to carry the cross I must bear;=More earnest effort to bring His Kingdom in;=More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.",
"More like the Master I would live and grow;=More of His love to others I would show;=More self-denial, like His in Galilee,=More like the Master I long to ever be"],

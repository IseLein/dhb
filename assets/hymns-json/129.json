"I have given up all for Jesus,=This vain world is naught to me;=All its pleasures are forgotten=In remembering Calvary.=Though my friends despise, forsake me,=And on me the world looks cold,=I've a Friend that will stand by me=When the pearly gates unfold.",
"When the voice of Jesus calls me,=And the angels whisper low,=I will lean upon my Saviour,=Through the valley as I go=I will claim His precious promise,=Worth to me the world of gold:=“Fear no evil, I'll be with thee,=When the pearly gates unfold.”",
"Just beyond the waves of Jordan,=Just beyond its chilling tide,=Blooms the Tree of Life immortal,=And the living waters glide:=In that happy land of spirits,=Are there stores of bliss untold,=And the angels are awaiting,=Where the pearly gates unfold."],
"chorus": "Life's morn will soon be waning,=And its evening bells be tolled,=But my heart will know no sadness=When the pearly gates unfold.",

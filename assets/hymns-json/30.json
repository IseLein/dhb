"We are labourers together with God,=We are not in, just labouring for God.=So we need to look up always to Him,=Who alone has the pattern and master design.=That as He directs us exactly as we do;=Moving with Him in every step.",
"The work has a master design made,=We must build according to pattern made.=Already laid is the foundation,=Be careful the way you build on that foundation=Through fire all your works done shall be tested:=Will your work abide or it shall be burden?",
"Be careful of the tricks that you play,=Thinking you are the owner of this work=Forget not that you are co-labourer;=The increase is given by our God, only God.=He gives seed to sowers and bread as food for you;=He â€˜ll increase the harvest of your righteousness.",
"They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.=He with tears goes forth bearing precious seed.=Shall doubtless return home rejoicing,=Bringing home joyfully his many sheaves with him.=Never watch the wind, do no look at the clouds,=The Lord who called you Faithful is He.",
"There is reward for all labourers;=Your reward is according to your work.=What have you built on the foundation?=Do you use silver, gold, wood, straw or precious stone?=A great day is coming a day of accounting!=How is your labour O Man of God?"],
"chorus": "I am labouring together with God=I am not the owner of this work.=So must I give the Lord full control=And then, follow on.",

"Open now Thou the crystal fountain=Whence the healing stream doth flow:=Let the fire and cloudy pillar=Lead me all my journey through:=Strong Deliverer! Strong Deliverer!=Be Thou still my strength and shield=Strong Deliverer! Strong Deliverer!=Be Thou still my strength and shield",
"When I tread the verge of Jordan,=Bid my anxious fears subside:=Bear me through the swelling torrent,=Land me safe on Canaan's side:=Songs of praises! Songs of praises!=I will ever give to Thee.=Songs of praises! Songs of praises!=I will ever give to Thee.",
"Saviour, come! We long to see Thee,=Long to dwell with Thee above;=And to know in full communion,=All the sweetness of Thy love=Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!=Take my waiting people home.=Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!=Take my waiting people home."],

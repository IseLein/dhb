"Oh, for a faith that will not shrink=Though pressed by many a foe=That will not tremble on the brink=of poverty or woe;-",
"That will not murmur or complain=Beneath the chastâ€™ning rod,=But, in the hour of grief or pain,=Can lean upon his God.",
"A faith that shines more bright and clear=When tempests rage without=That when in danger knows no fear=In darkness feels no doubt,-",
"A faith that keeps the narrow way=Till life's last spark is fled=And with a pure and heavenly ray=Lights up the dying bed.",
"Lord, give me such a faith as this,=And then, whate'er may come,=I taste e'en now the hallowed bliss=Of an Eternal Home."],

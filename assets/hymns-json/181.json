"Walk ye in Him, all earthly paths forsaking;=He lights the way to pardon from all sin;=He is the way, His promises sustaining;=Walk ye in Him, and feel his pow'r within.",
"Walk ye in Him, His footsteps ever follow;=Where'er they lead, o'er mountain, sea, or sand;=Serve Him today, He knows what waits the morrow,=Walk ye in Him, fulfill his great command.",
"Walk ye in Him, your path will lead to others,=No hands but yours can do His work today;=Go near and far to make all men your brothers,=Walk ye in Him, along the narrow way.",
"Walk ye in Him, ye who would tell the story;=Unlock your heart, receive His promise true;=Then tell the world of Jesus and His glory;=Walk ye in Him, and He will Walk with you."],

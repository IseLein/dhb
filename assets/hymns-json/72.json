"My hope is built on nothing less;=Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;=I dare not trust the sweetest frame,=But wholly lean on Jesus' name.",
"When darkness seems to hide His face,=I rest on His unchanging grace:=In every high and stormy gale,=My anchor holds within the veil.",
"His oath, His covenant, His blood,=Support me in the whelming flood,=When all around my soul gives way,=He then is all my hope and stay.",
"When He shall come with trumpet sound,=Oh, may I then in Him be found,=Dressed in His righteousness alone,=Faultless to stand before the throne!"],
"chorus": "On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand:=All other ground is sinking sand,=All other ground is sinking sand.",

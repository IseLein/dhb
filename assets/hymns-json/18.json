"I have one deep, supreme desire,=That I may be like Jesus.=To this I fervently aspire,=That I may be like Jesus.=I want my heart His throne to be,=So that a watching world may see=His likeness shining forth in me.=I want to be like Jesus.",
"He spent His life in doing good;=I want to be like Jesus=In lowly paths of service trod;=I want to be like Jesus=He sympathized with hearts distressed;=He spoke the words that cheered and blessed;=He welcomed sinners to His breast.=I want to be like Jesus.",
"A holy, harmless life He led;=I want to be like Jesus.=The Father's will, His drink and bread;=I want to be like Jesus=And when at last He comes to die,=“Forgive them, Father,” hear Him cry.=For those who taunt and crucify.=I want to be like Jesus",
"O perfect life of Christ, my Lord!=I want to be like Jesus.=My recompense and my reward,=That I may be like Jesus.=His Spirit fill my hung'ring soul,=His pow'r all my life control;=My deepest pray'r, my highest goal,=That I may be like Jesus."],

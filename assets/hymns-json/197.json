"Hark the Voice of Jesus calling,=Who will go and work today?=Fields are white, and harvest waiting,=Who will bear the sheaves away?”=Loud and long the master calleth=Rich rewards he offers thee;=Who will answer, gladly saying=Here am I, send me, send me”?",
"If you cannot cross the ocean=And the heathen land explore,=You can find the needy nearer=You can help those at your door;=If you can not give the thousands,=You can give the widows mite;=And the least you do for JESUS=Will be precious in his sight.",
"If you cannot sing like angels=If you cannot preach like Paul=You can tell the love of Jesus=You can say He died for all=If you cannot rouse the wicked,=With the judgement's dread alarm=You can lead the little children=To the Saviour's waiting arms.",
"If you cannot be the watchman,=Standing high on Zion's wall=Pointing out the path to Heaven=Offering life and peace to all=With your prayers and with your bounties=You can do what heaven demands=You can be like faithful Aaron,=Holding up the prophet's hands",
"If among the older people,=You may not be apt to teach=“Feed My lambs”, said Christ our Shepherd=“Place the food within their reach”,=And it may be that the children,=You have led with trembling hand=Will found among your jewels,=When you reach the better land.",
"Let none hear you idly saying=“There is nothing I can do,”=While the souls of men are dying=And the Master calls for you=Take the task He gives you gladly;=Let His work your pleasure be;=Answer quickly while He calleth=“Here I am, send me, send me.”"],

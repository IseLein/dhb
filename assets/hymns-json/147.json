"Go to dark Geth-sem-a-ne,=Ye who feel the tempt-er's pow'r;=Your Re-deem-er's con-flict see;=Watch with Him one bit-ter hour;=Turn not from His griefs a-way;=Learn of Je-sus Christ to pray.",
"Fol-low to the judg-ment hall;=View the Lord of life ar-raigned:=Oh, the worm-wood and the gall!=Oh, the pangs His soul sus-tained!=Shun not suf-fe'ring, shame, or loss;=Learn of Him to bear the cross.",
"Cal-v'ry's mourn-ful moun-tain climb;=There, a-dor-ing at His feet,=Mark that mir-a-cle of time,=God's own sac-ri-fice com-plete:=“It is fin-ished!” hear the cry;=Learn of Je-sus Christ to die.",
"Ear-ly has-ten to the tomb=Where they laid His breath-less clay;=All is sol-i-tude and gloom;=Who hath tak-en Him a-way?=Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes:=Sav-iour, teach us so to rise."],

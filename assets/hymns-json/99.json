"Make me a captive, Lord,=And then I shall be free;=Force me to render up my sword,=And I shall conqueror be.=I sink in life's alarms=When by myself I stand;=Imprison me within Thine arms,=And strong shall be my hand.",
"My heart is weak and poor=Until its Master find;=It has no spring of action sure,=It varies with the wind.=It cannot freely move=Till Thou hast wrought its chain;=Enslave it with Thy matchless love,=And deathless it shall reign.",
"My will is not my own=Till Thou hast made it Thine;=If it would reach a monarch's throne=It must its crown resign;=It only stands unbent=Amid the clashing strife,=When on Thy bosom it has leant=And found in Thee its life. A-men."],

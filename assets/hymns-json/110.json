"Your cause be mine, great Lord divine,=Your aim be my desire:=For wasted is my greatest strength=Unless it find expression in love=That gives itself away,=In life responsive to obey=The terms of Your commission.",
"Your cause be mine, great Lord divine,=This be my life's vocation:=To seek the prize when life is done=Your loving approbation diminish pride,=Increase my love,=O may Your Spirit now remove=All selfish motivation.",
"Your cause be mine, great Lord divine,=The world's emancipation:=To let Your light invade the dark=In every situation,=To prove You in a thousand ways,=To serve You well with zeal ablaze=Through life's unknown duration."],

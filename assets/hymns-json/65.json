"Is your life a channel of blessing?=Is the love of God flowing thro' you?=Are you telling the lost of the Saviour?=Are you ready His service to do?",
"Is your life a channel of blessing?=Are you burdened for those who are lost?=Have you urged upon those who are straying=The Saviour who died on the cross?",
"Is your life a channel of blessing?=Is it daily telling for Him?=Have you spoken the word of salvation=To those who are dying in sin?",
"We cannot be channels of blessing=If our lives are not free from known sin;=We will barriers be and a hindrance=To those we are trying to win."],

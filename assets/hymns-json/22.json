"The service of Jesus true pleasure affords,=In Him there is joy without an alloy;='Tis heaven to trust Him and rest on His Words;=It pays to serve Jesus each day.",
"It pays to serve Jesus what e'er may betide,=It pays to be true what e'er you may do;='Tis riches of mercy in Him to abide;=It pays to serve Jesus each day.",
"Tho' sometimes the shadows may hang o'er the way,=And sorrows may come to beckon us home,=Our precious Redeemer each toil will repay;=It pays to serve Jesus each day."],
"chorus": "It pays to serve Jesus, It pays ev'ry day,=It pays ev'ry step of the way;=Tho' the pathway to glory may sometimes be drear,=You 'll be happy each step of the way.",

"O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,=And all things else recede!=My heart be daily nearer Thee,=From sin be daily freed.",
"Each day let Thy supporting might,=My weakness still embrace;=My darkness vanish in Thy light,=Thy life my death efface.",
"In Thy bright beams which on me fall,=Fade every evil thought;=That I am nothing, Thou art all,=I would be daily taught.",
"More of Thy glory let me see,=Thou Holy, Wise, and True!=I would Thy living image be,=In joy and sorrow too.",
"Fill me with gladness from above,=Hold me by strength Divine:=Lord, let the glow of Thy great love,=Through my whole being shine.",
"Make this poor self grow less and less,=Be Thou my life and aim;=Oh, make me daily through Thy grace,=More meet to bear Thy name!"],

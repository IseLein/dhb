"Alas, and did my Saviour bleed,=And did my Sovereign die?=Would He devote that sacred head=For sinners such as I?",
"Was it for crimes that I had done=He groaned upon the tree?=Amazing pity, grace unknown,=And love beyond degree!",
"Well might the sun in darkness hide,=And shut his glories in,=When Christ the mighty Maker died=For man, the creature's sin.",
"Thus might I hide my blushing face=While Calv'ry's cross appears,=Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,=And melt mine eyes to tears.",
"But drops of grief can neâ€™er repay=The debt of love I owe;=Here, Lord, I give myself away,='Tis all that I can do.=Text : Isaac Watts;                             HUDSON=Music: Ralf E. Hudson;                        8.6.8.6. (C.M.)"],
"chorus": "At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,=And the burden of my heart rolled away,=It was there by faith I received my sight,=And now I am happy all the day!",

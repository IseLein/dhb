"O Lord, I give myself to Thee,=And all that I possess;=I lay aside my sinful pride=And claim Thy righteousness.=My will lies shattered at Thy feet,=I pray Thy will be done,=My only plea to live for Thee=And magnify Thy Son.",
"O may I count all gain but loss,=Save as to Thee 'tis gain;=Let me not shun the promised cross=Nor shirk to suffer pain.=Then lead me, Lord, up Calvary's hill,=Forth to the cross with Thee,=And there pour out my life with God,=As Thou didst Lord for me.",
"O humbly may I serve Thee, Lord,=As in Thy will I tread;=And may I live anew in Christ,=As risen from the dead.=Then closely walking by Thy side,=May love flow out thro' me,=That those whom Thou shalt lead my way=May too find life in Thee."],
"chorus": "May Christ be seen in me,=O Lord, Hear Thou my earnest plea;=O take me, fill me, use me, Lord,=Till Christ be seen in me.",

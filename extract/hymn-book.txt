E    very generation all along the line of the history of the
     church have a pattern of music which they use in
worship. The kind of music that any people produce is a
reflection of their heart condition and their relationship with
the Father. The songs carry the theology of the people and
reflect their understanding of God. Songs written in the time
of revival portray the people's experience of GOD.

Our nation is passing through a period of terrible
experience. Yet the cry in our heart is that God should send
us a revival. But we know certainly that any revival sent to
us at a time when right men who know the right methods of
ministry are not on the ground would be wasted. Thus,
before the revival comes, we need correct men who bears
the correct message and who knows the correct methods of
ministry. Such men who the master has sat upon and has
poured His life into them. These are the disciples of Jesus

Such men who lived and laboured in the yesteryears wrote
hymn that still communicate the mind of Christ. Here is a
compilation of some of such hymns and a few written by
men of like mind who are looking up to God for a visitation.

A careful look at the music played in the Church now shows
that the Church is in the wilderness. As we pray carefully
through these hymns, we are asking that God may visit His
saving grace upon our lives and grant us a revival that our
land may enter into rest.

   Lead me on to the light.
   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

2. When my way grows drear,
   Precious Lord, linger near,
   When my life is almost gone.
   Hear my cry, hear my call,
   Hold my hand lest I fall.
   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

   And the night draws near,
   And the day is past and gone
   At the river I stand,
   Guide my feet, hold my hand,
   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home

3. Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine!
   Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,
   All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride.

   Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

4. Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,
   Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
   Thro' endless ages ever to be
   Nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee,
   Nearer, my Saviour, still nearer to Thee.

   All I’ve sought, and hoped, and known;
   Yet how rich is my condition,
   God and Heav'n are still my own!

   They have left my Saviour, too;
   Human hearts and looks deceive me;
   Thou art not, like man, untrue;
   And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
   God of wisdom, love, and might,
   Foes may hate, and friends may shun me;
   Show Thy face, and all is bright.

3. Man may trouble and distress me,
   ‘Twill but drive me to thy breast;
   Life with trials hard may press me,
   Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest.
   O 'tis not in grief to harm me,
   While Thy love is left to me;
   O 'twere not in joy to charm me,
   Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

4. Haste thee on from grace to glory,
    Armed by faith, and winged by prayer;
    Heav'n's eternal day's before thee,
    God's own hand shall guide thee there.
    Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
    Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
    Hope shall change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

28.     I'VE DECIDED TO CHOOSE JESUS
        To this you were called because Christ suffered for
        you leaving you an example that you should follow
        in his steps. 1 Pet. 2:21
                                                         KEY G
1. Some folk may choose houses and land
   Some folk choose silver and gold
   These worldly wealth they may treasure
   And forget about their souls

   I’ve decided to choose Jesus
   The road in life may be rough
   And the going through the paths gets tough
   And the hills are hard to climb
   I’ve started out with the Master
   Long time ago in His steps
   Yes, there is no doubt in my mind
   I have made Jesus my choice

2. These clothes may be ragged that I wear
   Heavy the load that I bear
   Yet the kingdom path I shall tread
   Till I see the Master’s face

3. Poor and wretched though I may be
   Neglected by friends and kin
   Yet I’ll follow Jesus my Lord
   Until to His rest I come

4. Though the world and its wealth I loose
   And my life along with them
   Yet press I unto His sweet rest
   And take my place in His court

1. You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase,
   And have earnestly, fervently prayed;
   But you cannot have rest or be perfectly blest
   Until all on the altar is laid.

  Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
  Your heart, does the Spirit control?
  You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest
  As you yield Him your body and soul.

2. Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
   And have peace and contentment always?
   You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill,
   On the altar your all you must lay.

3. O we never can know what the Lord will bestow
   Of the blessings for which we have prayed
   Till our body and soul He doth fully control,
   And our all on the altar is laid.

4. Who can tell all the love He will send from above,
   And how happy our hearts will be made;
   Of the fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet
   When our all on the altar is laid.

       Pray to the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
       forth labourers into his harvest. Matt. 9:38

1. We are labourers together with God,
   We are not in, just labouring for God.
   So we need to look up always to Him,
   Who alone has the pattern and master design.
   That as He directs us exactly as we do;
   Moving with Him in every step.

   I am labouring together with God
   I am not the owner of this work.
   So must I give the Lord full control
   And then, follow on.

2. The work has a master design made,
   We must build according to pattern made.
   Already laid is the foundation,
   Be careful the way you build on that foundation
   Through fire all your works done shall be tested:
   Will your work abide or it shall be burden?

3. Be careful of the tricks that you play,
   Thinking you are the owner of this work
   Forget not that you are co-labourer;
   The increase is given by our God, only God.
   He gives seed to sowers and bread as food for you;
   He ‘ll increase the harvest of your righteousness.

4. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
   He with tears goes forth bearing precious seed.
   Shall doubtless return home rejoicing,
   Bringing home joyfully his many sheaves with him.
   Never watch the wind, do no look at the clouds,
   The Lord who called you Faithful is He.

5. There is reward for all labourers;
   Your reward is according to your work.
    What have you built on the foundation?
    Do you use silver, gold, wood, straw or precious stone?
    A great day is coming a day of accounting!
    How is your labour O Man of God?

32.    ARM ME LORD FOR REVIVAL
       O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years,…
       in wrath remember mercy. Hab. 3:2
                                                       KEY G
1. Arm me LORD for revival
   To turn my generation to thee;
   To thy glory course of history to change;
   To thy acknowledgement all hears to bring;
   To cause every knee for thee to bow
   Arm me, else impotent I am.

   Arm me LORD, for true revival.
   Uncircumcised hearts around me abound,
   Men so deep in sin and wickedness.
   Yet helpless, impotent, blunt I am
   Deliver me from this body of death, O LORD
   Shape and sharpen me for revival.

2. Daily LORD in my heart I cry:
   “Will thou not revive us again?”
   This I know you need me as a vessel,
   A new cruise, prepared and meet for your use,
   Yet crude, and unclean and shallow I am,
   Cleanse, mould and fit me for revival.

3. What a wretched man LORD, I am;
   Thought yearning to win the souls of men
   My intellect and wisdom has failed me;
   My efforts have achieved no lasting fruit
   Truly, in my flesh dwells no good thing!
   Arm me LORD, for genuine revival.

4. Create in me the revival life
   My life, weak for revival has proved,
   Blunt in circumcising men's hearts around,
   Impotent in confronting my mountains.
    Before Thee prostrate I LORD, for help.
    Trim and equip me for revival.

5. To thy throne LORD, again I come.
   Earnest pleading for a touch divine.
   Release me not until I am revived;
   Detain me until fully helped I am.
   Till my glory only be in the cross.
   Arm me LORD, for revival I pray.

   And I will follow Thee.

   Give me a clean heart so I may serve Thee.
   Lord, fix my heart so that I may be used by Thee.
   For I'm not worthy of all these blessings.
   Give me a clean heart and I'll follow Thee.

2. Sometimes I am up, sometimes I am down,
   Sometimes I am almost level to the ground.
   Please give me, Lord, a clean heart,
   That I may follow Thee.
   Give me a clean heart, a clean heart
   And I will follow Thee.

    Fill your weak spirit with alarm;

    And brace your heart and nerve your arm.

    Let not your foolish pride rebel;
    The Lord for us the cross endured,
    To save our souls from death and hell.

    Think not till death to lay it down;
    For only those who bear the cross
    May hope to wear the glorious crown.

   Who march 'neath Christ's banner, His own little band;
   We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
   And rest in the light of His beautiful land.

   And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
   But God's Holy spirit shall comfort the weary;
   We follow the Saviour and cannot turn back;
   The Master hath called us: tho' doubt and temptation
   May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
   “Press onward, look up-ward,” thro' much tribulation;
   The children of Zion must follow their King.

   With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
   We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
   To cast in our lot with the people of God:
   The Master hath called us, His sons and His daughters,
   We plead for His blessing and trust in His love;
   And thro' the green pastures, beside the still waters,
   He'll lead us at last to His Kingdom above.

   I sought the cross of Jesus, To give me peace within;
   I brought my soul to Jesus, He cleansed it in His blood;
   And in the cross of Jesus I found my peace with God.

2. I love the cross of Jesus, It tells me what I am
   A vile and guilty creature, Saved only thro' the Lamb;
   No righteousness nor merit, No beauty can I plead;
   Yet in the cross I glory, My title there I read.

3. I trust the cross of Jesus, In every trying hour,
   My sure and certain refuge, My never failing tow'r;
   In every fear and conflict, I more than conqueror am;
   Living, I'm safe, or dying, Thro' Christ, the risen Lamb.

4. Safe in the cross of Jesus! There let my weary heart
   Still rest in peace unshaken, Till with Him, ne’er to part;
   And then in strains of glory I'll sing His wondrous pow'r,
   Where sin can never enter, And death is known no more.

1. If I gained the world but lost the Saviour,
   Were my life worth living for a day?
   Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
   In the things that soon must pass away?
   If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,
   Would my gain be worth the life-long strife?
   Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
   For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

2. Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
   And a name revered both far and near,
   Yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting
   Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer
   If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,
   Who endured the cross and died for me,
   Could then all the world afford a refuge,
   Whither in my anguish I might flee?

3. O what emptiness without the Saviour
   Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
   And eternity, how dark without Him
   Only night and tears and endless woe!
   What though I might live without the Saviour,
   When I come to die, how would it be?
   O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
   And without Him all eternity!

4. O the joy of having all in Jesus!
   What a balm the broken heart to heal!
   Ne'er a sin so great but He'll forgive it,
   Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
   If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
   Nothing else in all the world beside,
   O then every thing is mine in Jesus
   For my needs and more He will provide.

   Amazing pity, grace unknown,
   And love beyond degree!
3. Well might the sun in darkness hide,
   And shut his glories in,
   When Christ the mighty Maker died
   For man, the creature's sin.
4. Thus might I hide my blushing face
   While Calv'ry's cross appears,
   Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
   And melt mine eyes to tears.
5. But drops of grief can ne’er repay
   The debt of love I owe;
   Here, Lord, I give myself away,
   'Tis all that I can do.

       Present your bodies a living sacrifice ... unto God.

   To the service of the Lord.

   Turn away from sin and sadness,
   Be transformed with life anew.

   They are gifts from God above,

   Tithes and offerings with you bring.
   In your work, with Him find favour,
   And with joy His praises sing.

3. God's command to love each other
   Is required of everyone.
   Showing mercy to each other
   Mirrors His redeeming Son.
   In compassion He has given
   Of His love that is divine;
   On the cross sins were forgiven;
   Joy and peace are fully thine.

4. Come in praise and adoration,
   All who on Christ's name believe.
   Worship Him with consecration,
   Grace and love will you receive.
   For His grace give Him the glory,
   For the Spirit and the Word,
   And repeat the gospel story
   Till the world His name has heard.

   O Praise my God, it reaches me

   Fast bound in sin and nature's night.
   Thine eye diffused a quickening ray;

   I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
   Amazing love! How can it be
   That Thou, my God, should die for me!


4. No condemnation now I dread:
   Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
   Alive in Him, my living Head,
   And clothed in righteousness divine,
   Bold I approach the eternal throne,
   And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
   Amazing love! How can it be
   That Thou, my God, should die for me!

   So that men might live again in the Image of God!

   Now that I from the cry of my guilt am relieved,
   I will live for my Lord, Not for gain or reward,
   But for love thinking of what His grace has restored!
   I'll never comprehend redemption's plan
   How Christ could condescend to die for man;
   Such a Saviour I'll praise to the end of my days,

1. O Lord, I give myself to Thee,
   And all that I possess;
   I lay aside my sinful pride
   And claim Thy righteousness.
   My will lies shattered at Thy feet,
   I pray Thy will be done,
   My only plea to live for Thee
   And magnify Thy Son.

   May Christ be seen in me,
   O Lord, Hear Thou my earnest plea;
   O take me, fill me, use me, Lord,
   Till Christ be seen in me.

2. O may I count all gain but loss,
   Save as to Thee 'tis gain;
   Let me not shun the promised cross
   Nor shirk to suffer pain.
   Then lead me, Lord, up Calvary's hill,
   Forth to the cross with Thee,
   And there pour out my life with God,
   As Thou didst Lord for me.

3. O humbly may I serve Thee, Lord,
   As in Thy will I tread;
   And may I live anew in Christ,
   As risen from the dead.
   Then closely walking by Thy side,
    May love flow out thro' me,
    That those whom Thou shalt lead my way
    May too find life in Thee.

   His life His death and resurrection:
   In fellowship to experience Him more,
   Who is a man, and not a ghost.
   Father show me more of Jesus,

   To His fullness that I may grow.
   To follow in His steps always.

   That I may know Him!
   Father show me more of Jesus,
   Holy Spirit reveal Him to me.
   My cry, my prayer, my aim is one:
   That I may know Him
   Who is God's only pattern for me.

2. Jesus Christ the only Son of God,
   Yet grew like a root out of dry ground.
   He was perfected by God through suffering.
   Leaving for us example to walk.
   When insulted retaliated not:
   When He suffered He made no threat.
   Why then should I complain of pains
   Meant to perfect my ways in Him.

3. Jesus Christ the only pattern Son.
   Tempted in all ways but did no sin.
   Hated sin, but loved righteousness!
   Therefore God exalted Him high.
   To be like Jesus my heart longs,
   Ready to shed my blood than to sin;
   To be clear minded on my goal
   Nothing but Jesus, all I want.

4. By His Nature, He is truly God,
   Yet as a Branch He choose to be;
   Depending on God in everything,
   Doing only the will of God.
   Impart this secret Lord to me,
   That in thy will my own to be lost;
   Help me a branch always to be,
   Never to live independent life.

5. Tho' in very Nature He is God,
   He surrendered His rights as God
   In obedience He became servant
   And as a man, died on the cross…
   What unequalled humility
   What a lowliness of the hearts!
   Help me to drop my rights, O Lord
   So that Jesus be formed in me.

6. Oh, that I may know more of Jesus!
   His prayer life, love and compassion.
   His resurrection power I long to know,
   To break all wrong yokes off my life.
   Guide me Lord in your steps to walk,
   Doing nothing after the flesh.
   Transform me till I'm wholly thine
   That Jesus be my all in all.

   He'll always be with us, if we do our part,
   There's naught in this wide world can pleasure afford,
   There's peace and contentment in serving the Lord.

   I'll love Him far better than in days of youth
   I'll serve Him more truly than ever before,
   I'll do as He bids me whatever the cost,
   I'll be a true soldier, I'll die at my post.

2. And often when I'm tempted to turn from the track
   I think of my Saviour, my mind wanders back,
   To the cross where they nailed Him on Calvary's tree
   I hear a voice saying, “I suffered for thee,”

3. A place I remember where I was set free,
   It’s where I found pardon, a heaven to me,
   There Jesus spoke sweetly, to my weary soul,
   My sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole.

   O come to the Saviour to Calvary flee,

   Thou wilt my need supply;

   Then shall my heart keep singing,
   While to the cross I cling;
   For rest is sweet at Jesus feet,
   While homeward faith keeps winging,
   While homeward faith keeps winging.

2. I care not for the empty show
   That thoughtless worldlings see;
   But gladly do the best I know,
   And leave the rest with Thee;
   Well satisfied that sweet reward
   Is sure to those who trust the Lord.

3. Whate’er the crosses mine shall be,
   I would not dare to shun;
   But only ask to live for Thee,
   And that Thy will be done;
   Thy will, O Lord, be mine each day,
   While pressing on my homeward way.
                                I WOULD NOT ASK FOR EARTHLY STORE


4. And when at last, my labour o’er,
   I cross the narrow sea,
   Grant, Lord, that on the other shore
   My soul may dwell with Thee;
   And learn what here I cannot know,
   Why Thou hast ever loved me so.

    I will call upon the Lord,

    I will call upon the Lord,

    The Lord reigneth; blessed be the Lord

121.       ONLY REMEMBERED
           For God is not unrighteous to forget your
           work and labour of love, which ye have
           shewed toward his name... Heb 6:10          KEY Eb
1. Fading away like the stars of the morning
   Losing their light in the glorious sun
   Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling
   Only remembered by what we have done.

    Only remembered, only remembered;
    Only remembered by what we have done,
    Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling
    Only remembered by what we have done.

2. Shall we be missed, though by others succeeded
   Reaping the fields we in springtime have sown?
   Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours
   Ever remembered, by what they have done.

3. Only the truth that in life we have spoken;
   Only the seed that on earth we have sown;
   These shall pass onwards when we are forgotten
   Fruits of the harvest and what we have done.

4. Oh! When the Saviour shall make up His jewels
   When the bright crowns of rejoicing are won,
   Then shall His weary and faithful disciples
   All be remembered by what they have done.

   This vain world is naught to me;

   I've a Friend that will stand by me
   When the pearly gates unfold.

   Life's morn will soon be waning,
   And its evening bells be tolled,
   But my heart will know no sadness
   When the pearly gates unfold.

2. When the voice of Jesus calls me,
   And the angels whisper low,
   I will lean upon my Saviour,
   Through the valley as I go
   I will claim His precious promise,
   Worth to me the world of gold:
   “Fear no evil, I'll be with thee,
   When the pearly gates unfold.”

3. Just beyond the waves of Jordan,
   Just beyond its chilling tide,
   Blooms the Tree of Life immortal,
   And the living waters glide:
                                                  I HAVE GIVEN UP ALL

    In that happy land of spirits,
    Are there stores of bliss untold,
    And the angels are awaiting,
    Where the pearly gates unfold.

           But ye shall receive power, after that the
           Holy Ghost is come upon you... Acts 1:8
                                                         KEY G
1. Set my soul a-fire, Lord for Thy ho-ly Word,
   Burn it deep within me, Let Thy voice be heard;
   Mil-lions grope in dark-ness in this day and hour,
   I will be a witness, fill me with Thy pow'r

   Set my soul a-fire, Lord, set my soul a-fire,
   Make my life a wit-ness of Thy of sav-ing pow'r.
   Mil-lions grope in dark-ness, wait-ing for Thy Word,
   Set my soul a-fire, Lord, set my soul a-fire.

2. Set my soul a-fire, Lord, for the lost in sin,
   Give to me a passion as I seek to win;
   Help me not to falter, nev-er let me fail,
   Fill me with Thy Spirit, let Thy will pre-vail.

3. Set my soul a-fire, Lord in my daily life,
   Far too long I've wan-der in this day of strife;
   Noth-ing else will matter but to live for Thee,
   I will be a wit-ness, for Christ lives in me.

1. God of grace and God of glo-ry,
   On Thy peo-ple pour Thy power;

   Bring her bud to glo-rious flower.
   Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,
   For the fac-ing of this hour,
   For the fac-ing of this hour
2   Lo! The hosts of e-vil round us
    Scorn Thy Christ, as-sail His ways!
    Fears and doubts too long have bound us,
    Free our hearts to work and praise.
    Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,
    For the liv-ing of these days,
    For the liv-ing of these days.
3. Cure thy children warring madness
   Bend our pride to thy control
   Shame our wanton selfish gladness
   Rich in things and poor in soul
   Grant us wisdom, grant us courage
   Lest we miss thy kingdom's goal
   Lest we miss thy kingdom's goal
4. Set our feet on loft-y plac-es;
   Gird our lives that they may be
   Ar-mored with all Christ-like grac-es
   In the fight to set men free.
   Grant us wis-dom, grant us cour-age,
   That we fail not man nor thee!
   That we fail not man nor thee!

                                                       KEY G
1. Oh, for a clos-er walk with God,
   A calm and heav'n-ly frame,
   A light to shine up-on the road
   That leads me to the Lamb!
2. Where is the bless-ed-ness I knew
   When first I saw the Lord?
   Where is the soul-re-fresh-ing view
   Of Je-sus and His Word?
3. What peace-ful hours I then en-joyed!
   How sweet their mem-'ry still!
   But they have left an ach-ing void
   The world can nev-er fill.
4. Re-turn, O Ho-ly Dove, re-turn,
   Sweet mes-sen-ger of rest;
   I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
   And drove Thee from my breast
5. The dearest idol I have know,
   Whate'er that idol be
   Help me to tear it from Thy throne
   And worship Only Thee
6. So shall my walk be close with God,
   Calm and serene my frame;
   So purer light shall mark the road
   That leads me to the Lamb.

   Seal it for thy courts a-bove.

          For God so loved the World… John 3:16
                                              KEY F
1. How deep the Father's love for us
   How vast beyond all measure,
   That He should give His only Son
   To make a wretch His treasure
   How great the pain of searing loss-
   The Father turns His face away
   As wounds which mar the Chosen One
   Bring many sons to glory.

2. Behold the man upon a cross
   My sin upon His shoulders
   Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
   Call out among the scoffers
   It was my sin that held Him there
   Until it was accomplished
   His dying breath has brought me life
   I know that it is finished.

3. I will not boast in anything
   No gifts, no power, no wisdom
   But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
   His death and resurrection,
   Why should I gain from His reward?
   I cannot give an answer
   But this I know with all my heart-
   His wounds have paid my ransom.

          O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art
          clothed with honour and majesty. Ps. 104:1
                                                  KEY Ab

   O gratefully sing, His power and His love:
   Our Shield and Defender,
   The Ancient of Days,
   Pavilioned in splendour,
   And girded with praise.
2. O tell of His might, O sings of His grace,
   Whose robe is the light, Whose canopy space.
   His chariots of wrath
   The deep thunder-clouds form,
   And dark is His path
   On the wings of the storm.
3. Thy bountiful care, What tongue can recite?
   It breathes in the air, It shines in the light,
   It streams from the hills,
   It descends to the plain,
   And sweetly distils
   In the dew and the rain.
4. Frail children of dust, And feeble as frail;
   In Thee do we trust, Nor find Thee to fail;
   Thy mercies, how tender,
   How firm to the end,
   Our Maker, Defender,
   Redeemer and Friend!.
5. O measureless Might! Ineffable Love!
   While angels delight, To hymn Thee above,
   The humbler creation,
    Though feeble their lays,
    With true adoration
    Shall lisp to Thy praise.

        Rev. 17:13
                                                KEY C
1. O how great the burden in God's heart is so deep
   For His will and His purpose on earth.
   Daily His heart groans and weeps bitterly,
   As many souls dwell in the darkness of sin;
   Nations perishing without Jesus.
   How thoughtless to watch, folding our arms;
   But yet desire God in their lives to rule;
   We must rise to enthrone Jesus as King.

   Go Labour on and be spent for God;
   With all that we have we must go forth.
   In pursuit of this one precious goal:
   Enthroning Jesus in this generation as King
   Until men in righteousness to Him shall bow
   In sweet adoration eternally.

2. Why seated though time flies and souls go to hell,
   Sealing their doom despite the cross?
   Jesus His glory left and died to save us;
   Why count the cost to take Jesus to men?
   What account have you before God to give?
   Where are the crowns at His feet to lay?
   This generation daily in sin groans,
   Needing Jesus to be enthroned as King.

3. Jesus in this world of sin must be enthroned;
   In spite of hells opposition and wrath.
   Though Satan in his prison men's heart has chained;
   Sufficient to save is the Arm of our God.
   In His strength labour I, while it is day;
   Seeking through tribes and cultures for souls;
   Across mountains, valleys, oceans with light:
   Until Jesus as their king is enthroned.

4. By wishful thought Jesus cannot be enthroned;
   Neither through comfort, convenience nor dreams.
   Self knowledge and wisdom cannot enthrone Him:
   Unless transformed life, abiding in Christ,
   And deliberate labour bearing the cross,
   By prayer and fasting, groaning with faith:
   Satan barriers will surely give way.
   So is Jesus in our life time enthroned.

5. Though great and mighty be the task before me,
   Yet fear not I, for my help is the LORD,
   From my flesh daily oh Lord, deliver me,
   That I in thy grace and mercy rely;
   Before thee lay I for thy touch divine;
   By-pass me not in this glorious labour.
   Here I am, LORD, ready for thee to use,
   In my days to enthrone Jesus as King.

   Whom in heav'n but Thee.

   Who lovingly guarded my footsteps
   And gives me a song in the night.

   Shall reigns eternally.

   If the way of the cross I miss.

    The way of the cross leads home,
    The way of the cross leads home;
    It is sweet to know as I onward go,
    The way of the cross leads home.

2. I must needs go on in the blood sprinkled way,
   The path that the Saviour trod,
   If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
   Where the soul is at home with God.

3. Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
   To walk in it never more;
   For the Lord says, “Come,” and I seek my home,
   Where He waits at the open door.

   Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there;

   And your health you can't regain,
   And your soul is almost sinking in despair,
   Jesus knows the pain you feel,

3. When your enemies assail
   And your heart begins to fail,
   Don't forget that God in heaven answers prayer;
   He will make a way for you and will lead you safely thru;
   Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.

    Take your burden to the Lord and leave it there.

1. When we walk with the Lord, In the light of His word,
   What a glory He sheds on our way!
   While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
   And with all who will trust and obey.

    Trust and obey!, For there's no other way
    To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.

2. Not a shadow can rise, Not a cloud in the skies,
   But His smile quickly drives it away;
   Not a doubt nor a fear, Not a sigh nor a tear,
   Can abide while we trust and obey.

3. Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share,
   But our toil He doth richly repay;
   Not a grief nor a loss, Not a frown nor a cross.
   But is blest if we trust and obey.

4. But we never can prove, The delights of His love,
   Until all on the altar we lay;
   For the favour He shows, And the joy He bestows
   Are for them who will trust and obey

5. Then in fellowship sweet, We will sit at His feet,
   Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
   What He says we will do, Where He sends we will go,
   Never fear, only trust and obey.

         But ye have an unction from the Holy One,
         and ye know all things. 1 John 2:20

1. Give us o Lord, Thine unction
   Anoint us for Thy work
   Arise and set us in motion,
   O Lord the man of war

2. Baptize us Lord with Thy fire
   And set our soul aflame
   To burn and shine for Thy cause;
   Revive your zeal in us

3. Refine us Lord and cleanse us
   Clothe us in holiness
   Transform our thoughts and nature
   Till we your glory show.

4. New hearts, more love, more passion
   For souls in satan's train
   With hook or net use us still;
   Make us fishers of men.

5. Not gold, not power, not knowledge,
   Will thy heaven unlock
   But prayer and faith and unity,
   Will bring the latter rain.

6. With tears and groans and fasting
   O Lord help us to pray
   Travailing as in birth for souls
   Till you revive the church.

    Following Him wherever He leads
    Following Him wherever He leads

         Greater love hath no man than this, that
         a man lay down his life for his friends.
         John 15:13
                                               KEY F
1. What a friend we have in Jesus,
   All our sins and griefs to bear;
   What a privilege to carry
   Ev'rything to God in prayer
   Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
   Oh, what needless pain we bear-
   All because we do not carry
   Ev'rything to God in prayer.

2. Have we trials and temptations?
   Is there trouble anywhere?
   We should never be discouraged,
   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
   Can we find a Friend so faithful,
   Who will all our sorrows share?
   Jesus knows our every weakness
   Take it to the Lord in prayer.

3. Are we weak and heavy laden
   Cumbered with a load of care?
   Precious Saviour, still our refuge,-
   Take it to the Lord in prayer,
   Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
                                           WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS


   Take it to the Lord in prayer;
   In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
   Thou wilt find a solace there.

   For the living God.
178.       VICTORY IN JESUS
           …this is the victory that overcometh
           the world, even our faith. 1 John 5:4
                                                   KEY G
1. I heard an old, old story
   How Saviour came from glory,
   How He gave His life on Calvary,
   To save a wretch like me;
   I heard about His groaning;
   Of His precious blood's atoning,
   Then I repented of my sins, And won the victory.
  O victory, in Jesus, My Saviour, forever,
  He sought me, and bought me, With His redeeming blood;
  He loved me ere I knew Him, And all my love is due him,
  He plunged me to victory, Beneath the cleansing flood.
2. I heard about His healing,
   Of His cleansing pow'r revealing,
   How he made the lame to walk again
   And caused the blind to see;
   And then cried. “Dear Jesus,
   Come and heal my broken spirit”,
   And somehow Jesus came and bro't, To me the victory.
3. I heard about a mansion
   He has built for me in glory,
   And I heard about the streets of gold
   Beyond the crystal sea;
   About the angels singing
   And the old redemption story;
   And some sweet day I'll sing up there, The song of victory.

          For which of you, intending to build a tower,
          sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost?
          Luke 14:28
                                                       KEY G
1. There's a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord
   Where the call of His spirit is lost,
   And you hurry along
   With the pleasure mad throng-
   Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

    Have you counted the cost, if your soul should be lost?
    Tho' you gain the whole world for your own?
    Even now it may be
    that the line you have crossed,
    Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

2   You may barter your hope of eternity's morn,
    For a moment of joy at the most,
    For the glitter of sin
    And the things it will win-
    Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

3   While the door of His mercy is open to you,
    Ere the depth of His love you exhaust,
    Won't you come and be healed,
    Won't you whisper, I yield-
    I have counted, I have counted the cost.

   Naught of this world's delusive dreams
   I have renounced all sinful pleasure
   Jesus is mine, there's nothing between

   Nothing between, my soul and my Saviour
   So that His blessed face may be seen
   Nothing preventing the least of His favour
   Keep thy way clear! Let nothing between

2. Nothing between like worldly pleasure
   Habits of life though harmless they seem
   Must not my heart from Him ever sever
   He is my all; there's nothing between.

3. Nothing between like pride or station
   Self or friends shall not intervene
   Tho' it may cost me much tribulation
   I am resolved; there's nothing between

4. Nothing between e'en many hard trials
   Tho' the whole world against me convene
   Watching with prayer and much self denial
   I'll triumph at last, with nothing between.

       He that saith he abideth in him ought
           himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

   He lights the way to pardon from all sin;
   He is the way, His promises sustaining;
   Walk ye in Him, and feel his pow'r within.

2. Walk ye in Him, His footsteps ever follow;
   Where'er they lead, o'er mountain, sea, or sand;
   Serve Him today, He knows what waits the morrow,
   Walk ye in Him, fulfill his great command.

3. Walk ye in Him, your path will lead to others,
   No hands but yours can do His work today;
   Go near and far to make all men your brothers,
   Walk ye in Him, along the narrow way.

4. Walk ye in Him, ye who would tell the story;
   Unlock your heart, receive His promise true;
   Then tell the world of Jesus and His glory;
   Walk ye in Him, and He will Walk with you.

   For in thee all things hold together
   Exercise thy authority on earth;
   To thy Lordship now, I humbly bow.

2. Thou art Lord indeed, o my redeemer,
   The image of the invisible God
   In Thee dwells the Godhead bodily
   And in Thee is life, light for all men.

3. Yes! Thy throne Jesus, is forevermore
   Nothing can challenge Thy authority
   To Thee bow principalities and powers
   To Thy Lordship, Jesus, I fully bow.

4. Thou art Lord indeed, I worship Thee
   Live Thy life within and control me
   That through me Thy Lordship on earth be known
   For the nations to bow to Thee as Lord.

1. To God be the glory great things he hath done
   So loved He the world that he gave us His son
   Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
   And opened the life gate that all may go in

   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
   Let the earth hear his voice
   Praise the Lord praise the Lord
   Let the people rejoice
   Oh come to the Father through Jesus the son,
   And give Him the glory great things He hath done.

2. O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
   To every believer the promise of God
   The vilest offender who truly believes
   That moment from Jesus a pardon receives

3. Great things He hath taught us great things He hath done
   And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son
   But purer and higher and greater will be
   Our wonder our transport when Jesus we see.

          God in one body by the cross, having slain
          the enmity thereby: Eph 2:16
                                                   KEY C
1. Years I spent in vanity and pride,
   Caring not my Lord was Crucified,
   Knowing not it was for me
   He died on Calvary.

    Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
    Pardon there was multiplied to me;
    There my burdened soul found liberty,
    At Calvary.

2. By God's Word at last my sin I learned;
   Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
   Till my guilty soul imploring turned
   To Calvary.

3. Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'ry thing,
   Now I gladly own Him as my King,
   Now my raptured soul can only sing
   Of Calvary

   Oh, the grace that bro't it down o man!
   Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span

   Ask the Saviour to help you,
   Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;

   Bad language disdain,

   Look ever to Jesus,
   He'll carry you through

   God giveth a crown,

197.     HARK THE VOICE OF JESUS CALLING
         Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom
         shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I,
         Here am I; send me. Isa 6:8
                                                    KEY F
1. Hark the Voice of Jesus calling,
   Who will go and work today?
   Fields are white, and harvest waiting,
   Who will bear the sheaves away?”
   Loud and long the master calleth
   Rich rewards he offers thee;
   Who will answer, gladly saying
   Here am I, send me, send me”?

2. If you cannot cross the ocean
   And the heathen land explore,
   You can find the needy nearer
   You can help those at your door;
   If you can not give the thousands,
   You can give the widows mite;
   And the least you do for JESUS
   Will be precious in his sight.

3. If you cannot sing like angels
   If you cannot preach like Paul
   You can tell the love of Jesus
   You can say He died for all
   If you cannot rouse the wicked,
   With the judgement's dread alarm
   You can lead the little children
   To the Saviour's waiting arms.

4. If you cannot be the watchman,
   Standing high on Zion's wall
   Pointing out the path to Heaven
   Offering life and peace to all
   With your prayers and with your bounties
   You can do what heaven demands
   You can be like faithful Aaron,
   Holding up the prophet's hands

5. If among the older people,
   You may not be apt to teach
   “Feed My lambs”, said Christ our Shepherd
   “Place the food within their reach”,
   And it may be that the children,
   You have led with trembling hand
   Will found among your jewels,
   When you reach the better land.

6. Let none hear you idly saying
   “There is nothing I can do,”
   While the souls of men are dying
   And the Master calls for you
   Take the task He gives you gladly;
   Let His work your pleasure be;
   Answer quickly while He calleth
   “Here I am, send me, send me.”

   A bulwark never failing
   Our helper He, amid the flood

   His craft and power are great,
   And, armed with cruel hate,
   On earth is not his equal.

2. Did we in our own strength confide,

   Were not the right Man on our side,
   The Man of God's own choosing;

   From age to age the same,

   Should threaten to undo us,
   We will not fear for God hath willed

   His rage we can endure,
   For lo, his doom is sure,
   One little word shall fell him.

   No thanks to them, abideth;
   The Spirit and the gifts are ours
   Thro' Him who with us sideth:
   Let goods and kindred go,
   This mortal life also;
   The body they may kill:
   God's truth abideth still,
   His Kingdom is forever.

    Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;
    Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
    Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love!

2. Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear,
   When the breakers roar and the reef is near?
   While the surges rave, and the wild winds blow,
   Shall the angry waves then your bank o'er flow

3. Will your anchor hold in the floods of death,
   When the waters cold chill your latest breath?
   On the rising tide, you can never fail,
   While your anchor holds within the veil.

4. Will your eyes behold through the morning light
   The city of gold and the harbour bright?
   Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore,
   When life's storms are past for evermore?

    For mercies so great, what return can I make?
    For mercies so constant and sure
    I'll love Him, I'll serve Him with all that I have
    As long as my life shall endure.

2. They greet me at morn when I woken from sleep,
   And they gladden my heart at the noon;
   They follow me on into shades of the night,
   When the day with its labour is done.

3. His angels of mercy encompass me 'round,
   Wheresoever my pathway may lead;
   Each turn of the road some new token reveals
   Oh! For me life is blessed indeed.

4. His goodness and mercy will follow me still,
   Even unto the end of the way.
   I have His sure promise and that cannot fail,
   That His mercy endureth for aye

   This ends my fears and doubts
   A sinful soul I come to Him
   He'll never cast me out

   Salvation by my Saviour's Name
   Salvation through His Blood

   For me His precious Blood He shed
